The role of the World Bank","ABSTRACT":"The World Bank is increasingly active in the area of climate change mitigation. While it justifies this engagement with its poverty reduction objective and its capacity to pave the way for new business activities in developing countries, critics blame the World Bank as a \u201cclimate profiteer\u201d and as an unfair competitor in private markets. Our econometric analysis of over 2,000 projects registered until May 2010 under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol allows us to compare the activities of the Bank with those of other, primarily private actors. The results indicate that hardly any of the CDM projects can be considered as strongly pro-poor. Nevertheless, in comparison to the rest of the CDM projects, the Bank\u2019s portfolio shows a relatively clearer orientation towards poor countries. Within these countries, however, the Bank does not show any particular pro-poor focus, and tends to implement those projects that are commercially most attractive. Moreover, there is no evidence of the Bank phasing out its activities once the market becomes fully operational, which goes against its professed pioneering and catalytic role in carbon markets.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/53448","predictions":"First, I analyze the main topics of the abstract:\n\nThe abstract discusses the role of the World Bank in climate change mitigation, specifically in the context of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol.

Rates of eligible individuals not receiving social transfers and ineligible individuals receiving them tend to be high, constraining the effectiveness of such anti-poverty programs. While interventions to incentivize or monitor local agents in charge of selecting beneficiaries are typically expensive, an important complementary and cost-effective approach could be to reform eligibility criteria to facilitate the selection of beneficiaries. Whether reforms should focus on reducing the number of rules, or selecting criteria which are easy to verify, or do both remains an unanswered question. We address this knowledge gap based on India\u2019s social pension scheme for elderly poor. We find that making eligibility criteria easier to verify has the potential to achieve a substantial improvement in the targeting performance through a reduction in the exclusion error. Those who meet the relevant criteria have a much higher chance of actually becoming beneficiaries. Since eligibility criteria can be changed at low cost, this suggests a viable route for reform in many developing countries. However, a major caveat remains that criteria must sufficiently well reflect actual poverty if the more accurate selection of beneficiaries according to formal criteria shall also translate into actual poverty reduction.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/219394","predictions":"First, analyze the main topics: The scientific abstract discusses the issue of ineffective targeting of social transfers towards vulnerable populations, specifically in developing countries.

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:30019","TITLE":"Does increasing blood pH stimulate protein synthesis in dialysis patients?","ABSTRACT":"BACKGROUND: Although the mechanism of muscle wasting in end-stage renal disease is not fully understood, there is increasing evidence that acidosis induces muscle protein degradation and could therefore contribute to the loss of muscle protein stores of patients on hemodialysis, a prototypical state of chronic metabolic acidosis (CMA). Because body protein mass is controlled by the balance between synthesis and degradation, protein loss can occur as result of either increased breakdown, impaired synthesis, or both. Correction of acidosis may therefore help to maintain muscle mass and improve the health of patients with CMA. We evaluated whether alkalizing patients on hemodialysis might have a positive effect on protein synthesis and on nutritional parameters. METHODS: Eight chronic hemodialysis patients were treated daily with oral sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO(3)) supplementation for 10-14 days, yielding a pre-dialytic plasma bicarbonate concentration of 28.6 +\/-1.6 mmol\/l. The fractional synthesis rates (FSR) of muscle protein and albumin were obtained by the L-[(2)H(5)ring]phenylalanine flooding technique. RESULTS: Oral NaHCO(3 )supplementation induced a significant increase in serum bicarbonate (21.5 +\/- 3.4 vs. 28.6 +\/- 1.6 mmol\/l; p = 0.018) and blood pH (7.41 vs. 7.46; p = 0.041).

We have no clear evidence demonstrating a significant survival benefit for either of these approaches, the selection between treatments is not always straightforward and can come down to physician and patient preference. The very heterogeneous definition of resectability of N2 disease makes the decision-making process even more complex.\r\nMethods: We evaluated the treatment strategies for preoperatively diagnosed stage III cN2 NSCLC among Swiss thoracic surgeons and radiation oncologists. Treatment strategies were converted into decision trees and analysed for consensus and discrepancies.

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:224567","TITLE":"Methodological choices in brucellosis burden of disease assessments: A systematic review","ABSTRACT":"Background\r\nFoodborne and zoonotic diseases such as brucellosis present many challenges to public health and economic welfare. Increasingly, researchers and public health institutes use disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to generate a comprehensive comparison of the population health impact of these conditions. DALYs calculations, however, entail a number of methodological choices and assumptions, with data gaps and uncertainties to accommodate. Thisreview identifies existing brucellosis burden of disease studies and analyzes their methodological choices, assumptions, and uncertainties. It supports the Global Burden of Animal Diseases programme in the development of a systematic methodology to describe the impact of animal diseases on society, including human health.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods\/Principal findings\r\nA systematic search for brucellosis burden of disease calculations was conducted in pre-selected international and grey literature databases. Using a standardized reporting framework, we evaluated each estimate on a variety of key methodological assumptions necessary to compute a DALY. Fourteen studies satisfied the inclusion criteria (human brucellosis and quantification of DALYs). One study reported estimates at the global level, the rest were national or subnational assessments. Data regarding different methodological choices were extracted, including detailed assessments of the adopted disease models. Most studies retrieved brucellosis epidemiological data from administrative registries. Incidence data were often estimated on the basis of laboratory-confirmed tests. Not all studies included mortality estimates (Years of Life Lost) in their assessments due to lack of data or the assumption that brucellosis is not a fatal disease. Only two studies used a model with variable health states and corresponding disability weights. The rest used a simplified singular health state approach. Wide variation was seen in the duration chosen for brucellosis, ranging from 2 weeks to 4.5 years, irrespective of the whether a chronic state was included.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nAvailable brucellosis burden of disease assessments vary widely in their methodology and assumptions. Further research is needed to better characterize the clinical course of brucellosis and to estimate case-fatality rates. Additionally, reporting of methodological choices should be improved to enhance transparency and comparability of estimates. These steps will increase the value of these estimates for policy makers.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/224567","predictions":"First, analyze the main topics of the abstract:\n\nThe abstract discusses the methodology and assumptions used in burden of disease assessments, specifically focusing on brucellosis.

Physicians were asked to identify key steps in the patient pathway relating to patient presentation, diagnosis and referral, in addition to other treatment and follow-up processes.\r\nResults: The interviewed physicians reported that late presentation with dcSSc was common, with some patients presenting to primary care physicians after symptoms had persisted for up to 1 year. Awareness of dcSSc is reported to vary widely among primary care physicians. Final diagnosis, generally following guideline-based recommendations, was by rheumatologists in most cases (or internal medicine physicians in France) and they remained responsible for global patient management, with lesser involvement in diagnosis and management by dermatologists. Specialist centres were not well defined and did not exist in all countries.\r\nConclusion: Patients and primary healthcare providers can be unaware of the symptoms of dcSSc, therefore presentation and referral to specialist care are often late. Thus, improved awareness among patients and primary care physicians is necessary to facilitate earlier referral and diagnosis. Once referred, more consistent use of the modified Rodnan skin score at diagnosis and follow-up may help to monitor disease progression.

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:218003","TITLE":"Nano dimensions\/adjuvants in COVID-19 vaccines","ABSTRACT":"A favorable outcome of the COVID-19 crisis might be achieved with massive vaccination. The proposed vaccines contain several different vaccine active principles (VAP), such as inactivated virus, antigen, mRNA, and DNA, which are associated with either standard adjuvants or nanomaterials (NM) such as liposomes in Moderna's and BioNTech\/Pfizer's vaccines. COVID-19 vaccine adjuvants may be chosen among liposomes or other types of NM composed for example of graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes, micelles, exosomes, membrane vesicles, polymers, or metallic NM, taking inspiration from cancer nano-vaccines, whose adjuvants may share some of their properties with those of viral vaccines. The mechanisms of action of nano-adjuvants are based on the facilitation by NM of targeting certain regions of immune interest such as the mucus, lymph nodes, and zones of infection or blood irrigation, the possible modulation of the type of attachment of the VAP to NM, in particular VAP positioning on the NM external surface to favor VAP presentation to antigen presenting cells (APC) or VAP encapsulation within NM to prevent VAP degradation, and the possibility to adjust the nature of the immune response by tuning the physico-chemical properties of NM such as their size, surface charge, or composition. The use of NM as adjuvants or the presence of nano-dimensions in COVID-19 vaccines does not only have the potential to improve the vaccine benefit\/risk ratio, but also to reduce the dose of vaccine necessary to reach full efficacy. It could therefore ease the overall spread of COVID-19 vaccines within a sufficiently large portion of the world population to exit the current crisis.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/218003","predictions":"First, analyze the main topics of the abstract:\n\nThe abstract discusses the potential benefits of using nano-adjuvants in COVID-19 vaccines, specifically exploring the mechanisms of action and advantages of using nanomaterials (NM) in vaccine development.

In this article, we propose thinking beyond the practical problems caused by co-infections in order to explore medicine\u2019s epistemological attachment to the idea of single diseases, using TB\/HIV as an analytical lever. We retrace how TB\/HIV co-infection has been problematised in public health discourses since the 1990s, particularly in WHO reports and international public health journals, and show that it has been mainly discussed as a complex biosocial phenomenon in need of more resources. The epistemological interrogation of the concept of co-infection itself \u2013 as an entangled object of two or more diseases with different histories and social, political, and scientific identities \u2013 is largely missing.

Based on the well-known retrieval structure model, the memory strength of phonemes and graphemes should be strengthened by visual and auditory associations between graphemes and phonemes. Using specifically designed training software, we examined whether establishing a multitude of visuo-auditory associations might help to mitigate writing errors in children with developmental dyslexia.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Forty-three children with developmental dyslexia and 37 carefully matched normal reading children performed a computer-based writing training (15-20 minutes 4 days a week) for three months with the aim to recode a sequential textual input string into a multi-sensory representation comprising visual and auditory codes (including musical tones). The study included four matched groups: a group of children with developmental dyslexia (n=20) and a control group (n=18) practiced with the training software in the first period (3 months, 15-20 minutes 4 days a week), while a second group of children with developmental dyslexia (n=23) (waiting group) and a second control group (n=19) received no training during the first period. In the second period the children with developmental dyslexia and controls who did not receive training during the first period now took part in the training.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Children with developmental dyslexia who did not perform computer-based training during the first period hardly improved their writing skills (post-pre improvement of 0-9%), the dyslexic children receiving training strongly improved their writing skills (post-pre improvement of 19-35%). The group who did the training during the second period also revealed improvement of writing skills (post-pre improvement of 27-35%). Interestingly, we noticed a strong transfer from trained to non-trained words in that the children who underwent the training were also better able to write words correctly that were not part of the training software. In addition, even non-impaired readers and writers (controls) benefited from this training.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Three-month of visual-auditory multimedia training strongly improved writing skills in children with developmental dyslexia and non-dyslexic children.

This increase has been linked to visual expertise for print, implying a protracted monotonic development. We investigated the development of coarse neural tuning for print by studying children longitudinally before and after learning to read, and comparing them to skilled adults. The coarse N1 tuning, which had been absent in nonreading kindergarten children, emerged in less than 2 years after the same children had mastered basic reading skills in 2nd grade. The N1 became larger for words than symbol strings in every child, and this coarse tuning was stronger for faster readers. Fast brain processes thus specialize rapidly for print when children learn to read, and play an important functional role in the fluency of early reading. Comparing 2nd graders with adults revealed a further decrease of the coarse N1 tuning in adults, presumably reflecting further reading practice. This constitutes a prominent nonlinear development of coarse neurophysiological specialization for print. The maximum tuning in novice readers possibly reflects the high sensitivity of their neural network for visual aspects of print, and a more selective tuning in expert adult readers.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/97368","predictions":"First, analyze the main topics: The abstract discusses the neural tuning process for print in children and adults, specifically the development of coarse neural tuning for print when children learn to read.

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:50775","TITLE":"Computer-based learning of spelling skills in children with and without dyslexia","ABSTRACT":"Our spelling training software recodes words into multisensory representations comprising visual and auditory codes. These codes represent information about letters and syllables of a word. An enhanced version, developed for this study, contains an additional phonological code and an improved word selection controller relying on a phoneme-based student model. We investigated the spelling behavior of children by means of learning curves based on log-file data of the previous and the enhanced software version. First, we compared the learning progress of children with dyslexia working either with the previous software (n\u2009=\u200928) or the adapted version (n\u2009=\u200937). Second, we investigated the spelling behavior of children with dyslexia (n\u2009=\u200937) and matched children without dyslexia (n\u2009=\u200925). To gain deeper insight into which factors are relevant for acquiring spelling skills, we analyzed the influence of cognitive abilities, such as attention functions and verbal memory skills, on the learning behavior. All investigations of the learning process are based on learning curve analyses of the collected log-file data. The results evidenced that those children with dyslexia benefit significantly from the additional phonological cue and the corresponding phoneme-based student model. Actually, children with dyslexia improve their spelling skills to the same extent as children without dyslexia and were able to memorize phoneme to grapheme correspondence when given the correct support and adequate training. In addition, children with low attention functions benefit from the structured learning environment. Generally, our data showed that memory sources are supportive cognitive functions for acquiring spelling skills and for using the information cues of a multi-modal learning environment.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/50775","predictions":"First, analyze the main topics of the abstract: The abstract discusses the development and evaluation of a computer-based learning software for children with and without dyslexia, specifically focusing on improving spelling skills.

The ability to read, indispensable to perform in today's society, necessitates a reorganization of visual cortex for fast letter recognition, but the developmental course of this process has not yet been characterized. Here, we show the emergence of visual sensitivity to letters across five electroencephalography measurements from kindergarten and throughout elementary school and relate this development to emerging reading skills. We examined the visual N1, the electrophysiological correlate of ventral occipito-temporal cortex activation in 65 children at varying familial risk for dyslexia. N1 letter sensitivity emerged in first grade, when letter sound knowledge gains were most pronounced and decayed shortly after when letter knowledge is consolidated, showing an inverted U-shaped development. This trajectory can be interpreted within an interactive framework that underscores the influence of top-down predictions. While the N1 amplitudes to letters correlated with letter sound knowledge at the beginning of learning, no association between the early N1 letter response and later reading skills was found. In summary, the current findings provide an important reference point for our neuroscientific understanding of learning trajectories and the process of visual specialization during skill learning.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/203378","predictions":"First, the main topics of this abstract can be summarized as follows:\n\n* The development of visual sensitivity to letters in children from kindergarten to elementary school\n* The relationship between the emergence of this sensitivity and emerging reading skills\n* The application of electroencephalography (EEG) measurements to study this development\n* The influence of top-down predictions on this process\n\nBased on these topics, the specific SDG target that this abstract covers is Target 4.1: \"By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free primary and secondary education of good quality and equip all children and youth with the skills for sustainable development.\"\n\nThis target is directly related to the abstract's focus on the development of reading skills in children, which is a crucial aspect of education.

This longitudinal study investigates how increasing second language proficiency influences activation differences during lexico-semantic processing of first and second language. Native English speaking exchange students learning German were examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging while reading words in three different languages at two points in time: at the beginning of their stay (day1) and 5 months later (day2), when second language proficiency had significantly increased. On day1, second language words evoked more frontal activation than words from the mother tongue. These differences were diminished on day2. We therefore conclude that with increasing second language proficiency, lexico-semantic processing of second language words needs less frontal control.

Gender Equality Policies in Japan since 2009","ABSTRACT":"After the change of government in 2009, many expected the new DPJ-led government to implement changes in Japanese society and politics. In the area of gender equality policies, new policymaking and implementation dynamics were anticipated. This paper aims at exploring the extent of policy change in the field of gender equality policies since the new government took office in 2009 by focusing on two policies that stood out on the agenda: the compilation of the Third Basic Plan for Gender Equality and the amendment of the Civil Code. In both cases, the prospects for policy change seemed similar, because the governing party was supposed to take up a more progressive stance towards gender equality, timing was fortunate, and the ministers in charge as well as Prime Minister Hatoyama were supporting policy change in these areas. Furthermore, lobbyists from within Japan and the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) Committee called on the Japanese government for action. The policy outcomes, however, turned out to be very different: While the Third Basic Plan for Gender Equality includes prominent new policy measures and is an example of visible policy change, plans for amending the Civil Code failed. The article argues that these differences are best explained by intraparty divisions over gender equality within the ruling DPJ which emerged especially since the party took over government.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/84993","predictions":"First, the main topics of this abstract are:\n\n* Government change and policy change in Japan, specifically in the area of gender equality policies\n* The implementation of two gender equality policies in Japan since 2009: the compilation of the Third Basic Plan for Gender Equality and the amendment of the Civil Code\n* The analysis of the outcomes of these policies and the factors that influenced their success\n\nJustification of the specific SDG target:\n\nThe abstract focuses on gender equality policies in Japan, which aligns with Target 5.5 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), \"Ensure women's full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership and political participation and equal participation in economic activity\".

What follows is an engagement with arguments developed by Hanna Papanek and Carroll Pastner in this journal some decades ago. They both drew on fieldwork experiences in Pakistan to argue that foreign women fieldworkers can (sometimes) take advantage of ambiguities in the social structures of Purdah societies, that is, societies characterized by \u201csexual segregation and the seclusion of women\u201d (Pastner 1982:262), to flexibly position themselves and to be able to interact with both men and women. This paper rethinks their arguments and evaluates the current situation on the basis of fieldwork experience as a foreign woman in Pakistan in the late 2000s. It argues that possibilities for foreign women to get physical access to men\u2019s worlds, although still available, remain limited and in some ways have become more restricted (including access to women\u2019s worlds) due to political developments in recent decades. The paper also argues that, irrespective of the feasibility of physical access to other gender\u2019s worlds, it is necessary to reflect on subjectivities through which access to \u201cforeign\u201d worlds is mediated and knowledge is produced.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/98740","predictions":"First, I analyze the main topics of the abstract.

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:225858","TITLE":"Methodological Advances to Study Contaminant Biotransformation: New Prospects for Understanding and Reducing Environmental Persistence?","ABSTRACT":"Complex microbial communities in environmental systems play a key role in the detoxification of chemical contaminants by transforming them into less active metabolites or by complete mineralization. Biotransformation, i.e., transformation by microbes, is well understood for a number of priority pollutants, but a similar level of understanding is lacking for many emerging contaminants encountered at low concentrations and in complex mixtures across natural and engineered systems. Any advanced approaches aiming to reduce environmental exposure to such contaminants (e.g., novel engineered biological water treatment systems, design of readily degradable chemicals, or improved regulatory assessment strategies to determine contaminant persistence a priori) will depend on understanding the causal links among contaminant removal, the key driving agents of biotransformation at low concentrations (i.e., relevant microbes and their metabolic activities), and how their presence and activity depend on environmental conditions. In this Perspective, we present the current understanding and recent methodological advances that can help to identify such links, even in complex environmental microbiomes and for contaminants present at low concentrations in complex chemical mixtures. We discuss the ensuing insights into contaminant biotransformation across varying environments and conditions and ask how much closer we have come to designing improved approaches to reducing environmental exposure to contaminants.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/225858","predictions":"First, describe the main topics of the abstract: The abstract discusses the importance of understanding contaminant biotransformation in complex environmental systems, particularly for emerging contaminants present at low concentrations in complex chemical mixtures.

The approval of the first large-scale methodology took more than 2 years and in the interaction with the regulatory bodies, the methodology became very cumbersome, especially regarding monitoring requirements. Four sample groups are required and the technology that has to be used for measuring utilization of CFLs does not yet exist.

But even the small-scale methodology requires a substantial amount of data and measurements. A \u201cProgramme of Activity\u201d approach could reduce monitoring costs through limiting monitoring to a sample of projects. Moreover, monitoring experts could be trained and thus monitoring mistakes reduced compared to single project settings.

Estimates published over the last decade diverge by up to four orders of magnitude \u2014 from 0.0064 kilowatt-hours per gigabyte (kWh\/GB) to 136 kWh\/GB. This article presents a review of the methodological approaches used so far in such assessments: i) top\u2013down analyses based on estimates of the overall Internet energy consumption and the overall Internet traffic, whereby average energy intensity is calculated by dividing energy by traffic for a given period of time, ii) model-based approaches that model all components needed to sustain an amount of Internet traffic, and iii) bottom\u2013up approaches based on case studies and generalization of the results. Our analysis of the existing studies shows that the large spread of results is mainly caused by two factors: a) the year of reference of the analysis, which has significant influence due to efficiency gains in electronic equipment, and b) whether end devices such as personal computers or servers are included within the system boundary or not. For an overall assessment of the energy needed to perform a specific task involving the Internet, it is necessary to account for the types of end devices needed for the task, while the energy needed for data transmission can be added based on a generic estimate of Internet energy intensity for a given year. Separating the Internet as a data transmission system from the end devices leads to more accurate models and to results that are more informative for decision makers, because end devices and the networking equipment of the Internet usually belong to different spheres of control.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/96522","predictions":"First, analyze the main topics of the abstract:\n\nThe main topics of the abstract are:\n\n* Assessing the energy intensity of Internet transmissions\n* Reviewing methodological approaches used in such assessments\n* Identifying factors contributing to the spread of results (year of reference and inclusion of end devices)\n* Suggesting a framework for accurate modeling and decision-making\n\nNext, justify which concrete target within the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) aligns directly with these topics:\n\nThe target that aligns directly with these topics is Target 9.4: \"By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to achieve resource-efficient and resilient systems.\"\n\nJustification:\n\n* The abstract focuses on assessing the energy intensity of Internet transmissions, which is crucial for developing resource-efficient systems.\n* The review of methodological approaches and identification of factors contributing to the spread of results aim to improve the accuracy of energy intensity assessments, which is essential for achieving resource-efficient systems.\n* The suggested framework for accurate modeling and decision-making will help decision-makers make informed choices about infrastructure upgrades and industrial retrofits, aligning with the target's emphasis on resilient systems.\n\nFinal determination:\n\nBased on the target identified, the corresponding SDG assignment is:\n\nSDG 9, focusing on Target 9.4, \"By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to achieve resource-efficient and resilient systems.\"","SDG":9}

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:193890","TITLE":"Event-Based Angular Velocity Regression with Spiking Networks","ABSTRACT":"Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are bio-inspired networks that process information conveyed as temporal spikes rather than numeric values. An example of a sensor providing such data is the event-camera. It only produces an event when a pixel reports a significant brightness change. Similarly, the spiking neuron of an SNN only produces a spike whenever a significant number of spikes occur within a short period of time. Due to their spike-based computational model, SNNs can process output from event-based, asynchronous sensors without any pre-processing at extremely lower power unlike standard artificial neural networks. This is possible due to specialized neuromorphic hardware that implements the highly-parallelizable concept of SNNs in silicon. Yet, SNNs have not enjoyed the same rise of popularity as artificial neural networks. This not only stems from the fact that their input format is rather unconventional but also due to the challenges in training spiking networks. Despite their temporal nature and recent algorithmic advances, they have been mostly evaluated on classification problems. We propose, for the first time, a temporal regression problem of numerical values given events from an event-camera. We specifically investigate the prediction of the 3- DOF angular velocity of a rotating event-camera with an SNN. The difficulty of this problem arises from the prediction of angular velocities continuously in time directly from irregular, asynchronous event-based input. Directly utilising the output of event-cameras without any pre-processing ensures that we inherit all the benefits that they provide over conventional cameras. That is high-temporal resolution, high-dynamic range and no motion blur. To assess the performance of SNNs on this task, we introduce a synthetic event-camera dataset generated from real-world panoramic images and show that we can successfully train an SNN to perform angular velocity regression.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/193890","predictions":"First, I analyze the main topics of the abstract, which include:\n\n* Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and their unique characteristics\n* Event-based sensors and their advantages over conventional sensors\n* The challenge of training SNNs and the need for new algorithms and techniques\n* The prediction of numerical values from events using SNNs\n* The application of SNNs to a specific problem, in this case, the prediction of angular velocity from an event-camera\n\nFrom these topics, I identify and justify the specific SDG target that the abstract covers.

These results suggest a risk\u2013return trade-off to educational investments into more specific skills. Second, the skill distance is negatively associated with wages.

We analyse, how a decline in trade costs affects outsourcing activities and the production structure in the small economy. A stimulation of cross-border outsourcing raises wage dispersion and, if labour markets are unionized, also the employment of high-skilled relative to low-skilled labour. Using a panel of Austrian industries, we find, first, that decreasing trade barriers - as observed after the fall of the Iron Curtain - indeed stimulate outsourcing to Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and, second, that outsourcing to these countries significantly shifts relative employment in favour of high-skilled labour.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/2287","predictions":"First, I analyze the main topics of the abstract: The abstract discusses the impact of outsourcing and decreasing trade barriers on the production structure and employment in a small industrialized country, specifically Austria, after the fall of the Iron Curtain.\n\nThe main topics are:\n\n1.

Evidence from a Natural Field Experiment","ABSTRACT":"Employment contracts are often incomplete, leaving many responsibilities subject to workers\u2019 discretion. High work morale is therefore essential for sustaining voluntary cooperation and high productivity in firms. We conducted a field experiment to test whether workers reciprocate wage cuts and raises with low or high work productivity. Wage cuts had a detrimental and persistent impact on productivity, reducing average output by more than 20 percent. An equivalent wage increase, however, did not result in any productivity gains. The results from an additional control experiment with high monetary performance incentives demonstrate that workers could still produce substantially more output, leaving enough room for positive reactions. Altogether, these results provide evidence consistent with a model of reciprocity, as opposed to inequality aversion.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/51506","predictions":"First, analyze the main topics of the abstract: The main topic is the investigation of the effect of wage cuts and raises on work morale and productivity, specifically examining whether workers reciprocate these changes with changes in output.\n\nJustify which concrete target within the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) aligns directly with these topics: The abstract primarily focuses on the impact of wage changes on productivity and work morale.

Studies have considered both responsive and proactive customer orientation. Competitor orientation, however, has been investigated more narrowly. Research has focused specifically on its responsive dimension, a firm's posture of quickly responding to its competitors' actions and their offerings; but has largely disregarded proactive competitor orientation, a firm's posture towards altering the market's competitive behavior in its favor. This study investigates the role of responsive and proactive competitor orientation on influencing innovation and firm performance, as well as the mediating effects of technology and learning orientation. Utilizing a unique dataset that combines primary and time-lagged secondary data from 306 firms, we find that both responsive and proactive competitor orientation are observable drivers of performance in the market, but in notably different ways. Proactive competitor orientation drives innovation performance, directly and through technology orientation. Responsive competitor orientation, instead, enhances firm performance through learning orientation.

These models may be used to generate representations of the future (imagination) and the past (episodic memory). In this paper we will explore some problems surrounding the representation of the present arising from the use of such models in the artificial cognitive system under development within the ECCEROBOT project. There are two aspects to consider: the representation of the state of the robot\u2019s body within the self model, and the representation of the state of the external world within the world model. In both natural and robotic systems, the processing of the sensory data carrying state information takes a considerable time, and so any estimates of the present states of both the agent and the world would have to be obtained by using predictive models. However, it appears that there is no need for any such representations to be generated in the course of selecting a course of action using self and world models, since representations are only of the future or the past.

Drawing on the needs-based model and the common-ingroup identity model, we hypothesized that the experience of accepting intergroup contact and the endorsement of a dual identity representation of intergroup relations would be associated with greater support for equality. Furthermore, integrating the logic of both models, we tested the novel hypothesis that the positive effect of accepting contact on support for equality would be stronger under a high (vs. low) dual identity representation. While the predicted main effects received empirical support, we found no evidence for the expected interaction. These findings suggest that interventions to foster support for social change among advantaged group members can promote accepting contact and a dual identity representation independently of each other.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/222117","predictions":"First, I analyze the main topics of the abstract.

How can we explain this increase in inequalities? Policies in labor markets, social policy, and political representation are strongly linked in the creation, widening, and deepening of insider-outsider divides\u2014a process known as dualization. While it is certainly not the only driver of increasing inequality, the encompassing nature of its development across multiple domains makes dualization one of the most important current trends affecting developed societies. However, the extent and forms of dualization vary greatly across countries. The comparative perspective of this book provides insights into why Nordic countries witness lower levels of insider-outsider divides, whereas in continental, liberal and southern welfare states, they are more likely to constitute a core characteristic of the political economy. Most importantly, the comparisons presented in this book point to the crucial importance of politics and political choice in driving and shaping the social outcomes of deindustrialization. While increased structural labor market divides can be found across all countries, governments have a strong responsibility in shaping the distributive consequences of these labor market changes. Insider-outsider divides are not a straightforward consequence of deindustrialization, but rather the result of political choice.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/86511","predictions":"First, describe the main topics of the abstract:\n\nThe main topics of the abstract are the increasing trend of inequality, social exclusion, and dualization in Western European societies, particularly in labor markets, social policy, and political representation.

We argue that disadvantaged groups experience threats to their agency whereas advantaged groups experience threats to their morality. Restoration of these aspects of groups\u2019 identities can unlock the potential for collective action among members of disadvantaged groups and for a greater willingness to change the status quo toward equality among members of advantaged groups. A major theoretical implication of these findings is that social psychological theorizing should pay greater attention to morally based motivations as critical factors in the facilitation of change. A prime practical implication is that interventions designed to improve intergroup relations should consider not only acceptance-related but also agency-related motivations (e.g., through a \u201ccommon stigmatizers identity\u201d re-categorization strategy).","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/94791","predictions":"First, analyze the main topics of the abstract:\n\nThe abstract discusses the concept of social change, specifically highlighting the importance of cooperation between advantaged and disadvantaged groups to achieve equality.

Even though urban areas and respective agglomerations have continuously gained in importance in Switzerland to this day, the Swiss national population census will no longer include commuter data at high spatial resolution. Hence, the definition of the rapidly evolving urban agglomeration concept will have to be modified for future urban research and planning purposes.\r\nWe propose a crowdsourcing approach to overcome this data gap, and employ the open and web-based Wikipedia encyclopedia as a new resource to delineate agglomeration areas. Using the North Eastern parts of Switzerland in this case study, we systematically evaluate whether user-generated content can serve as an option to fill the commuter data gap in future Swiss national population censuses to define agglomeration areas. In a second step, we evaluate the influence of potential edge effects on our chosen approach.\r\nWe employ the number of hyperlinks in the Wikipedia database to quantify the strength of functional relationships between municipalities appearing in the Wikipedia encyclopedia. Next, we visualize the extracted municipality network structure for the chosen study area. Finally, we cluster the connected municipalities to agglomeration zones, and compare the computed municipality clusters with the agglomeration areas currently defined by the Swiss census.\r\nOur results suggest that the aggregation structure of our crowdsourcing approach is congruent with the officially developed agglomeration areas proposed by the Swiss census. Crowdsourced data thus might be an additional future data resource to complement more traditional census statistics for space districting purposes or socio-economic research in urban geography and planning.\r\nHowever, our results also suggest that geographic space indeed influences even non-spatially organized, crowdsourced encyclopedic entries, and this must be systematically studied further in future studies.\r\nEnglish Title: Agglomerations newly defined with crowdsourced data: visualizing North Eastern Switzerland based on Wikipedia content.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/94156","predictions":"First, analyze the main topics of the abstract:\n\nThe main topics revolve around the concept of urban agglomeration and the use of crowdsourced data to redefine and visualize these areas, specifically in the North Eastern parts of Switzerland.

Traffic events are related to traffic accidents, congestion, parking issues, to name a few. Currently, traffic events are detected through static sensors e.g., CCTV camera, loop detectors. However they have limited spatial coverage and high maintenance cost, especially in developing regions. On the other hand, with Web 2.0 and ubiquitous mobile platforms, people can act as social sensors sharing different traffic events along with their locations. We investigated whether Twitter - a social media platform can be useful to understand urban traffic events from tweets in India. However, such tweets are informal and noisy and containing vernacular geographical information making the location retrieval task challenging. So far most authors have used geotagged tweets to identify traffic events which accounted for only 0.1%-3% or sometimes less than that. Recently Twitter has removed precise geotagging, further decreasing the utility of such approaches. To address these issues, this research explored how ungeotagged tweets could be used to understand traffic events in India. We developed a novel framework that does not only categorize traffic related tweets but also extracts the locations of the traffic events from the tweet content in Greater Mumbai. The results show that an SVM based model performs best detecting traffic related tweets. While extracting location information, a hybrid georeferencing model consists of a supervised learning algorithm and a number of spatial rules outperforms other models. The results suggest people in India, especially in Greater Mumbai often share traffic information along with location mentions, which can be used to complement existing physical transport infrastructure in a cost-effective manner to manage transport services in the urban environment.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/179196","predictions":"First, analyze the main topics:\n\nThe abstract discusses the potential of Twitter to understand traffic events and their locations in Greater Mumbai, India.

In this study we screened 5000 mini-Tn5 transposon insertion mutants of Burkholderia cenocepacia H111 for loss of cadmium tolerance. Of the four genes identified three affected outer membrane biogenesis and integrity or DNA repair. The fourth gene, BCAE0587, encoded a P1-type ATPase belonging to the CadA family of HM exporters. CadA-deficient strains lost the ability to grow in the presence of cadmium, zinc and lead, whereas resistance to nickel, copper and cobalt was not affected.

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:199053","TITLE":"Comparison of Small Molecule Biotransformation Half-Lives between Activated Sludge and Soil: Opportunities for Read-Across?","ABSTRACT":"Compartment-specific degradation half-lives are essential pieces of information in the regulatory risk assessment of synthetic chemicals. However, their measurement according to regulatory testing guidelines is laborious and costly. Despite the obvious ecological and economic benefits of knowing environmental degradability as early as possible, its consideration in the early phases of rational chemical design is therefore challenging. Here, we explore the possibility to use half-lives determined in highly time- and work-efficient biotransformation experiments with activated sludge and mixtures of chemicals to predict soil half-lives from regulatory simulation studies. We experimentally determined half-lives for 52 structurally diverse agrochemical active ingredients in batch reactors with three concentrations of the same activated sludge. We then developed bi- and multivariate models for predicting half-lives in soil by regressing the experimentally determined half-lives in activated sludge against average soil half-lives of the same chemicals extracted from regulatory data. The models differed in how we accounted for sorption-related bioavailability differences in soil and activated sludge. The best-performing models exhibited good coefficients of determination (R2 of around 0.8) and low average errors (<factor of 3 in half-life predictions) and were robust in cross-validation. From a practical perspective, these results suggest that it may indeed be possible to read across from half-lives determined in highly efficient biotransformation experiments in activated sludge to soil half-lives, which are obtained from much more work- and resource-intense regulatory studies, and that these predictions are clearly superior to predictions based on the output of BIOWIN, a publicly available quantitative structure-biodegradation relationship (QSBR) model. From a theoretical perspective, these results suggest that soil and activated sludge microbial communities, although certainly different in terms of taxonomic composition, may be functionally similar with respect to the enzymatic transformation of environmentally relevant concentrations of a diverse range of chemical compounds.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/199053","predictions":"First, analyze the main topics:\n\nThe abstract discusses the comparison of small molecule biotransformation half-lives between activated sludge and soil, exploring the possibility of using biotransformation experiments with activated sludge to predict soil half-lives.

This article presents a comprehensive life cycle assessment comparison of four different lighting technologies: the tungsten lamp, the halogen lamp, the conventional fluorescent lamp and the compact fluorescent lamp. Taking advantage of the most up-to-date life cycle inventory database available (ecoinvent data version 2.01), all life cycle phases were assessed and the sensitivity of the results for varying assumptions analysed: different qualities of compact fluorescent lamps (production phase), different electricity mixes (use phase), and endof- life scenarios for WEEE recycling versus municipal solid waste incineration (disposal phase). A functional unit of \u201cone hour of lighting\u201d was defined and the environmental burdens for the whole life cycle for all four lamp types were calculated, showing a clearly lower impact for the two gas-discharge lamps, i.e. the fluorescent and the compact fluorescent lamp. Differences in the product quality of the compact fluorescent lamps reveal to have only a very small effect on the overall environmental performance of this lamp type; a decline of the actual life time of this lamp type doesn't result in a change of the rank order of the results of the here examined four lamp types. It was also shown that the environmental break-even point of the gasdischarge lamps is reached long before the end of their expected life-span. All in all, it can be concluded that a change from today's tungsten lamp technology to a low-energy-consuming technology such as the compact fluorescent lamp results in a substantial environmental benefit.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/55881","predictions":"First, analyze the main topics of the abstract: The main topics revolve around the environmental impacts of different lighting technologies, specifically comparing the life cycle assessment of four lamp types: tungsten, halogen, conventional fluorescent, and compact fluorescent lamps.\n\nThe main objectives of the abstract are:\n\n1.

Producing MIEDs requires resources, energy and causes considerable emissions. Extending the service life MIEDs could significantly reduce the demand for new devices and associated environmental impacts. However, whether service life extension actually reduces environmental impacts associated with MIEDs is still uncertain. First, available life cycle assessments of MIEDs suggest that the production of integrated circuits (ICs) accounts for the majority of GHG emissions during the production phase and that greenhouse gas emissions increase with the size of the device and, more importantly, with its storage capacity. However, there is only little information available on MIED specific components such as logic or memory type integrated circuits. In order to quantify environmental impacts of service life extension of MIEDs new approaches for life cycle inventory modelling (e.g. modular modelling) are required. Second, service life-extending measures are subject to rebound effects, which occur if the number of devices being produced does not fall as expected. Such effects depend on consumer behaviour (e.g. re-spending effects) and the rationalities of involved economic actors. Thus, environmental, behavioural and economic aspects have tobe taken into account in order to develop service life-extending measures that entail environmental benefits while being both economically viable and appealing to consumers.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/197669","predictions":"First, the main topics of this scientific abstract are:\n\n* The environmental implications of service life extension of mobile devices\n* The production of mobile internet-enabled devices (MIEDs) and its impact on resource consumption, energy usage, and emissions\n* The need for new approaches in life cycle inventory modeling and the consideration of consumer behavior and economic aspects to develop environmentally beneficial and economically viable measures\n\nBased on these topics, the specific SDG target that aligns with this abstract is:\n\nTarget 12.5: \"By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and minimization of, or properly manage, hazardous and other waste, having clear world targets and objectives and the encouragement of developing countries to move towards better practices.\"\n\nThis target is directly covered by the abstract, as it discusses the environmental implications of service life extension of MIEDs, which involves the reduction of waste generation through the extension of device lifetimes.\n\nFinal determination: The corresponding SDG assignment is SDG 12, focusing on Target 12.5.","SDG":12}

There are more than 2000 sites along the coast of Brazil that range in age from 8,720 to 985 cal BP. Here, we studied the ichthyoarchaeological remains (i.e., cranial\/postcranial bones, otoliths, and teeth, among others) at 13 shellmounds on the southern coast of the state of Rio de Janeiro, which are located in coastal landscapes, including a sandy plain with coastal lagoons, rocky islands, islets and rocky bays. We identified patterns of similarity between shellmounds based on fish diversity, the ages of the assemblages, littoral geomorphology and prehistoric fisheries. Our new radiocarbon dating, based on otolith samples, was used for fishery characterization over time. A taxonomical study of the ichthyoarchaeological remains includes a diversity of 97 marine species, representing 37% of all modern species (i.e., 265 spp.) that have been documented along the coast of Rio de Janeiro state. This high fish diversity recovered from the shellmounds is clear evidence of well-developed prehistoric fishery activity that targeted sharks, rays and finfishes in a productive area influenced by coastal marine upwelling. The presence of adult and neonate shark, especially oceanic species, is here interpreted as evidence of prehistoric fisheries capacity for exploitation and possibly overexploitation in nursery areas. Various tools and strategies were used to capture finfish in seasonal fisheries, over rocky reef bottoms and in sandy littoral environments. Massive catches of whitemouth croaker, main target dermersal species of South Atlantic coast, show evidence of a reduction in body size of approximately 28% compared with modern fisheries.

From a pre-bleaching benthic community in which living corals and epilithic algal matrix (EAM) predominated, Aldabra\u2019s reefs switched to an EAM-dominated community 8 months after bleaching. Soft corals declined by 93% of their overall pre-bleaching cover to \\ 1%. Although overall hard-coral cover was also reduced, the decline varied among depths and might indicate local adaptations of the lagoonal reef, due to greater variability in sea surface temperature compared to the seaward reef. With the exception of Isopora palifera, all taxomorphic coral groups experienced a decline following bleaching. Overall, Rhytisma experienced a near-complete extirpation, Acroporids (excluding I. palifera) and branching Poritids declined by more than 80%, Merulinidae lost ca. 60% of their pre-bleaching cover, while massive Poritids cover slightly decreased. Aldabra\u2019s benthic community therefore underwent substantial changes following the 2014\u20132017 bleaching event and showed that live coral cover declines significantly even in protected areas isolated from local anthropogenic pressures.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/189477","predictions":"First, analyze the main topics:\n\nThe main topics of this scientific abstract are:\n\n1.

In this study, we applied an ensemble species distribution modelling approach, combining results of six modelling algorithms to identify areas of high probability of occurrence of the globally Vulnerable Australian humpback dolphin in northern Ningaloo Marine Park (NMP), north-western Australia. Model outputs were based on sighting data collected during systematic, boat-based surveys between 2013 and 2015, and in relation to various ecogeographic variables. Water depth and distance to coast were identified as the most important variables influencing dolphin presence, with dolphins showing a preference for shallow waters (5\u201315 m) less than 2 km from the coast. Areas of high probability (>\u20090.6) of dolphin occurrence were primarily (90%) in multiple use areas where extractive human activities are permitted, and were poorly represented in sanctuary (no-take) zones.

Considerable economic development is expected in particularly for tourism, navigation and aquaculture. However, in recent years the environmental quality of the Bay has been degraded by human activities and impacts. Even though the conditions of the Bay are monitored with in-situ measurements in a marine station, the environmental data, measured only in half-yearly intervals, are not sufficient for comprehensively assessing environmental quality at various temporal and spatial scales.\r\nTherefore, it is necessary to seek for complementary data sources to assess, control and manage the marine\r\nenvironment of Nha Trang Bay. We conducted three field trips in Nha Trang Bay at 23 stations, including 6 off-shore stations that are not influenced by freshwater from land, and measured the distribution of marine optical properties. These properties include the light extinction coefficient (K) of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the surface layer (i.e. 1m depth) and in water columns. K ranged from 0.099 m-1 off-shore to 0.409 m-1 in coastal waters. In addition, light absorption at various wavelengths were used to assess the concentration of chlorophyll-a, total suspended sediments and primary production. Further, we collected and used spatially explicit data using the OC4 method and the method of band 1, 2 and 3 ratios of the Landsat TM satellite. A data comparison confirms a significant correlation between the different sources of in-situ and remotely sensed data of light absorption. However, the predicted values at stations with a water depth of less than 5 m are significantly affected by sea bottom reflection of, for example, mud, sand, coral reefs and algae.\r\nThe results indicate that it is appropriate to use remote sensing methods to derive spatially explicit distributed variables of optical properties and derived products for an environmental assessment of coastal waters.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/20359","predictions":"First, I analyze the main topics of the abstract.

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:218997","TITLE":"Using land-use history and multiple baselines to determine bird responses to cocoa agroforestry","ABSTRACT":"Agroforests can play an important role in biodiversity conservation in complex landscapes. A key factor distinguishing among agroforests is land-use history - whether agroforests are established inside forests or on historically forested but currently open lands. The disparity between land-use histories means the appropriate biodiversity baselines may differ, which should be accounted for when assessing the conservation value of agroforests. Specifically, comparisons between multiple baselines in forest and open land could enrich understanding of species' responses by contextualizing them. We made such comparisons based on data from a recently published meta-analysis of the effects of cocoa (Theobroma cacao) agroforestry on bird diversity. We regrouped rustic, mixed shade cocoa, and low shade cocoa agroforests, based on land-use history, into forest-derived and open-land-derived agroforests and compared bird species diversity (species richness, abundance, and Shannon's index values) between forest and open land, which represented the 2 alternative baselines. Bird diversity was similar in forest-derived agroforests and forests (Hedges' g* estimate [SE] = -0.3144 [0.3416], p = 0.36). Open-land-derived agroforests were significantly less diverse than forests (g* = 1.4312 [0.6308], p = 0.023) and comparable to open lands (g* = -0.1529 [0.5035], p = 0.76). Our results highlight how land-use history determined the conservation value of cocoa agroforests. Forest-derived cocoa agroforests were comparable to the available - usually already degraded - forest baselines, but entail future degradation risks. In contrast, open-land-derived cocoa agroforestry may offer restoration opportunities. Our results showed that comparisons among multiple baselines may inform relative contributions of agroforestry systems to bird conservation on a landscape scale.\r\n\r\nKeywords: agrobosque derivado de bosque; agrobosque derivado de campo abierto; agroecology; agroecolog\u00eda; cacao; conservaci\u00f3n; conservation; degradaci\u00f3n forestal; forest degradation; forest-derived agroforest; meta-analysis; open-land-derived agroforest; ornithology; ornitolog\u00eda; review; \u4fdd\u62a4; \u53ef\u53ef; \u6765\u81ea\u5f00\u9614\u5730\u7684\u519c\u6797\u3001\u9e1f\u7c7b\u5b66; \u6765\u81ea\u68ee\u6797\u7684\u519c\u6797; \u68ee\u6797\u9000\u5316; \u7efc\u8ff0; \u835f\u8403\u5206\u6790.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/218997","predictions":"First, analyze the main topics of the provided scientific abstract.

Given that not all species are equally threatened and that resources are always limited, establishing robust prioritisation schemes is critical for implementing effective conservation actions. To this end, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species has become a widely used source of information on species\u2019 extinction risk. Various metrics have been proposed that combine IUCN status with different aspects of biodiversity to identify conservation priorities. However, current strategies do not take full advantage of palaeontological data, with conservation palaeobiology often focussing on the near-time fossil record (the last 2 million years). Here, we make a case for the value of the deep-time (over 2 million years ago), as it can offer tangible parallels with today\u2019s biodiversity crisis and inform on the intrinsic traits that make species prone to extinction. As such, palaeontological data holds great predictive power, which could be harnessed to flag species likely to be threatened but that are currently too poorly known to be identified as such. Finally, we identify key IUCN-based prioritisation metrics and outline opportunities for integrating palaeontological data to validate their implementation. Although the human signal of the current extinction crisis makes direct comparisons with the geological past challenging, the deep-time fossil record has more to offer to conservation than is currently recognised.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/224628","predictions":"First, analyze the main topics of the abstract:\n\nThe main topics of this abstract are:\n\n1.

Drastic loss in genetic diversity at such loci constitutes an extinction risk and should be monitored in species of conservation concern. However, effective implementations of genome-wide immune polymorphism sets into high-throughput genotyping assays are scarce. Here, we report the design and validation of a microfluidics-based amplicon sequencing assay to comprehensively capture genetic variation in Alpine ibex (Capra ibex). This species represents one of the most successful large mammal restorations recovering from a severely depressed census size and a massive loss in diversity at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). We analysed 65 whole-genome sequencing sets of the Alpine ibex and related species to select the most representative markers and to prevent primer binding failures. In total, we designed ~1,000 amplicons densely covering the MHC, further immunity-related genes as well as randomly selected genome-wide markers for the assessment of neutral population structure. Our analysis of 158 individuals shows that the genome-wide markers perform equally well at resolving population structure as RAD-sequencing or low-coverage genome sequencing data sets. Immunity-related loci show unexpectedly high degrees of genetic differentiation within the species. Such information can now be used to define highly targeted individual translocations. Our design strategy can be realistically implemented into genetic surveys of a large range of species.

Global environmental change, including land transformation and contamination, is causing concerning insect diversity loss, articulated in the companion review Scientists' warning to humanity on insect extinctions. Yet, despite a sound philosophical foundation, recognized ethical values, and scientific evidence, globally we are performing poorly at instigating effective insect conservation. As insects are a major component of the tapestry of life, insect conservation would do well to integrate better with overall biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. This also involves popularizing insects, especially through use of iconic species, through more media coverage, and more inclusive education. Insect conservationists need to liaise better with decision makers, stakeholders, and land managers, especially at the conceptually familiar scale of the landscape. Enough evidence is now available, and synthesized here, which illustrates that multiple strategies work at local levels towards saving insects. We now need to expand these locally-crafted strategies globally. Tangible actions include ensuring maintenance of biotic complexity, especially through improving temporal and spatial heterogeneity, functional connectivity, and metapopulation dynamics, while maintaining unique habitats, across landscape mosaics, as well as instigating better communication. Key is to have more expansive sustainable agriculture and forestry, improved regulation and prevention of environmental risks, and greater recognition of protected areas alongside agro-ecology in novel landscapes.

Commercial forestry is the greatest threat to biodiversity in boreal forests. Forestry practices have degraded most available habitat, threatening the persistence of natural populations. Understanding population responses is, therefore, critical for their conservation. Population viability analyses are effective tools to predict population persistence under forestry management. However, quantifying the mechanisms driving population responses is complex as population dynamics vary temporally and spatially. Metapopulation dynamics are governed by local dynamics and spatial factors, potentially mediating the impacts of forestry e.g., through dispersal. Here, we performed a seasonal, spatially explicit population viability analysis, using long-term data from a group-living territorial bird (Siberian jay, Perisoreus infaustus). We quantified the effects of forest management on metapopulation dynamics, via forest type-specific demography and spatially explicit dispersal, and how forestry impacted the stability of metapopulation dynamics. Forestry reduced metapopulation growth and stability, through negative effects on reproduction and survival. Territories in higher quality natural forest contributed more to metapopulation dynamics than managed forests, largely through demographic processes rather than dispersal. Metapopulation dynamics in managed forest were also less resilient to disturbances and consequently, may be more vulnerable to environmental change. Seasonal differences in source-sink dynamics observed in managed forest, but not natural forests, were caused by associated seasonal differences in dispersal. As shown here, capturing seasonal source-sink dynamics allows us to predict population persistence under human disturbance and to provide targeted conservation recommendations.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/216365","predictions":"First, describe the main topics:\n\nThe main topics of this abstract are: (1) the impact of commercial forestry on wildlife populations and natural ecosystems, specifically on the Siberian jay population; (2) the effects of forestry management on metapopulation dynamics, including population growth, stability, and resilience to disturbances; and (3) the importance of capturing seasonal source-sink dynamics to predict population persistence and provide targeted conservation recommendations.\n\nSecond, identify and justify the specific SDG target:\n\nThe abstract's main topics directly relate to Target 15.5 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which states: \"Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and preserve natural habitats, forests, and biodiversity.\"\n\nThe abstract highlights the critical role of forestry management in degrading natural habitats, threatening the persistence of wildlife populations, and compromising biodiversity.

Yet this debate overlooks the influence of the broader societal context on organizational behavior. In this article, we argue that misbehaviors of organizations (the 'barrels') and their members (the 'apples') cannot be addressed properly without a clear understanding of their broader context (the 'larder').\r\nWhereas previously, a strong societal framework dampened the practical application of the Homo economicus concept (business actors as perfectly rational and egocentric utility-maximizing agents without any moral concern), specialization, individualization, and globalization led to a business world disembedded from broader societal norms. This emancipated business world promotes a literal interpretation of Homo economicus among business organizations and their members.\r\nConsequently, we argue that the first step toward 'healthier' apples and barrels is to sanitize the larder, that is, adapt the framework in which organizations and their members evolve.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/58072","predictions":"First, analyze the main topics of the abstract:\n\nThe main topics of this abstract revolve around the impact of societal context on organizational behavior, specifically the promotion of ethical behavior in business organizations.

Evolutionary models and empirical evidence indicate that such altruistic punishment has been a decisive force in the evolution of human cooperation. We used H2 15O positron emission tomography to examine the neural basis for altruistic punishment of defectors in an economic exchange. Subjects could punish defection either symbolically or effectively. Symbolic punishment did not reduce the defector's economic payoff, whereas effective punishment did reduce the payoff. We scanned the subjects' brains while they learned about the defector's abuse of trust and determined the punishment. Effective punishment, as compared with symbolic punishment, activated the dorsal striatum, which has been implicated in the processing of rewards that accrue as a result of goal-directed actions. Moreover, subjects with stronger activations in the dorsal striatum were willing to incur greater costs in order to punish. Our findings support the hypothesis that people derive satisfaction from punishing norm violations and that the activation in the dorsal striatum reflects the anticipated satisfaction from punishing defectors.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/49345","predictions":"First, the main topics of this scientific abstract are the neural basis of altruistic punishment, the cognitive mechanisms underlying human cooperation, and the processing of rewards in the brain.\n\nThe abstract suggests that people derive satisfaction from punishing norm violations, and this satisfaction is related to the activation in the dorsal striatum, a brain region involved in the processing of rewards. This implies that altruistic punishment is a crucial mechanism for promoting cooperation and maintaining social norms.\n\nBased on this, the specific SDG target that this abstract covers is Target 17.17: \"Encourage effective public-private partnerships aimed at achieving the SDGs, on a global scale and at the national and local levels.\"\n\nHowever, this target is not directly related to the abstract's focus on the neural basis of altruistic punishment. Instead, it seems that the abstract's findings could contribute to the development of more effective cooperative systems and social norms, which are essential for achieving many of the SDGs.\n\nTherefore, the corresponding SDG assignment for this abstract is SDG 17, focusing on Target 17.17.","SDG":17}

Episodic Priming May Not Provide the Answer","ABSTRACT":"Powerful people (e.g., political and business leaders) should be able to control their impulses and act in line with long-term rather than short-term interests. However, theories of power suggest different answers to the question whether the basic experience of feeling powerful decreases (e.g., Keltner, Gruenfeld, & Anderson, 2003) or increases self-control performance (e.g., Magee & Smith, 2013). We conducted a pre-registered direct replication of the only experiment testing the effects of power on self-control (Joshi & Fast, 2013, Study 3). In contrast to the original results, social power, operationalized by episodic priming, did not affect temporal discounting. A possible explanation is the fact that the power priming failed to elevate participants\u2019 sense of power. Thus, the null findings challenge the power priming paradigm rather than the two theories from which opposite predictions were derived. In order to understand how power affects self-control, future research may need to rely on other manipulations.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/135973","predictions":"First, analyze the main topics of the provided scientific abstract: The abstract discusses the concept of power and its potential impact on self-control, specifically examining the effects of power on temporal discounting.

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:188938","TITLE":"The cognitive foundations of cooperation","ABSTRACT":"We conducted an experiment causally manipulating reliance on more intuitive vs. more deliberative behavior through time pressure and time delay. Our design uses a novel manipulation which relies on gradual economic incentives and was devised to avoid the high degree of non-compliance observed in previous experiments. The \u201csocial heuristic hypothesis,\u201d which claims that people are intuitively predisposed to cooperate, is not supported in our data. On the aggregate, subjects are not more cooperative under gradually-incentivized time pressure. We also measured individual attitudes on social values and attitudes toward interpersonal risk, and find that both correlate with the tendency to cooperate. A detailed analysis suggests that subjects with a stronger (resp. weaker) prosocial predisposition become more (resp. less) cooperative under time pressure compared to time delay, although the effect is only noticeable for extreme-enough predispositions. A possible interpretation is that relying on more intuitive behavior enhances individual heterogeneous predispositions, while relying on more deliberative behavior moderates them.

It is facilitated when individuals represent not only their own actions but also those of their partner. Identifying whether action corepresentation is unique to humans or also present in other species is therefore necessary to fully understand the evolution of human cooperation. We used the auditory joint Simon task to assess whether action corepresentation occurs in common marmosets, a monkey species that engages extensively in coordinated action during cooperative infant care. We found that marmosets indeed show a joint Simon effect. Furthermore, when coordinating their behavior in the joint task, they were more likely to look at their partner than in a joint control condition. Corepresentation is thus not unique to humans but also present in the cooperatively breeding marmosets. Since marmosets are small-brained monkeys, our results suggest that routine coordination in space and time, rather than complex cognitive abilities, plays a role in the evolution of corepresentation.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/151869","predictions":"First, I analyze the main topics of the abstract:\n\nThe abstract primarily discusses the concept of corepresentation during joint action in marmoset monkeys, comparing it to human cooperation.

Management (diagnosis and treatment) of hypersensitivity disorders involves often intentional exposure to potentially allergenic substances (during skin testing), deliberate induction in the office of allergic symptoms to offending compounds (provocation tests) or intentional application of potentially dangerous substances (allergy vaccine) to sensitized patients. These situations may be associated with a significant risk of unwanted, excessive or even dangerous reactions, which in many instances cannot be completely avoided. However, adverse reactions can be minimized or even avoided if a physician is fully aware of potential risk and is prepared to appropriately handle the situation. Information on the risk of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in allergic diseases has been accumulated in the medical literature for decades; however, except for allergen specific immunotherapy, it has never been presented in a systematic fashion. Up to now no single document addressed the risk of the most commonly used medical procedures in the allergy office nor attempted to present general requirements necessary to assure the safety of these procedures. Following review of available literature a group of allergy experts within the World Allergy Organization (WAO), representing various continents and areas of allergy expertise, presents this report on risk associated with diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in allergology and proposes a consensus on safety requirements for performing procedures in allergy offices. Optimal safety measures including appropriate location, type and required time of supervision, availability of safety equipment, access to specialized emergency services, etc. for various procedures have been recommended.

METHODS  All original papers reporting epidemiological studies published in English, French, or German which reported on the risk of HA infection in workers exposed to sewage were eligible. They were identified by several methods and each original paper was assessed independently with a checklist by two people. Studies were classified according to the strength of their design. Non-eligible studies were also examined to assess the impact of publication bias. If the risk estimates diverged widely, causes for heterogeneity were assessed. A distinction was made between seroprevalence studies based on subclinical HA (defined only by the presence of anti-HA antibodies) and clinical HA.  RESULTS  17 eligible studies were identified. No indication of an increased risk of clinical HA could be found. For seroprevalence the studies with the strongest design suggested a slightly increased risk of subclinical HA with an odds ratio (OR) <2.5.

Experts from ten Swiss centres agreed to participate and provided their treatment algorithms. Their input was converted into decision trees based on the objective consensus methodology. The decision trees were used as a basis to identify consensus and discrepancies in clinical routine.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nSeveral criteria used for decision-making in postoperative RT\u00a0in meningiomas were identified: histological grading, resection status, recurrence, location of the tumour, zugzwang (therapeutic need to treat and\/or severity of symptoms), size,\u00a0and\u00a0cell division rate. Postoperative RT is recommended by all experts for WHO grade III tumours as well as for incompletely resected WHO grade II tumours. While most centres do not recommend adjuvant irradiation for WHO grade I meningiomas, some offer this treatment in recurrent situations or routinely for symptomatic tumours in critical locations. The recommendations for postoperative RT\u00a0for recurrent or incompletely resected WHO grade I and II meningiomas were surprisingly heterogeneous.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nDue to limited evidence on the utility of postoperative RT\u00a0for meningiomas, treatment strategies vary considerably among clinical experts depending on the clinical setting, even in a small country like Switzerland. Clear majorities were identified for postoperative RT\u00a0in WHO\u00a0grade III meningiomas and against RT for hemispheric grade I meningiomas outside critical locations.

Eighty-one measurements were carried out on urine and serum samples and the scientific results together with individual questionnaire information were entered into a central database. Data obtained was assessed centrally and individually in subsidiary studies. The measurable contributions were assessed either singly or in combination, of smoking, gender, metal exposure and site, to nephrotoxicity. The potential value of each test as an indicator of nephrotoxicity was then assessed on the basis of sensitivity and specificity. A number of new tests including prostaglandins and for extracellular matrix components were investigated as well as established tests for renal damage and dysfunction. The data obtained from this comprehensive study emphasises the value of noninvasive biomarkers for the early detection of nephrotoxicity due to environmental toxins. The urinary profile varied with the type of environmental\/occupational toxin. By careful selection of a small panel of markers they can be used to indicate the presence of renal damage, the principal region affected, and to monitor the progress of disease and damage.

Materials and Methods The study consisted of a retrospective part A for protocol development (n = 15) and a prospective part B to evaluate diagnostic accuracy (n = 38). All 53 participants underwent perfusion CT with 50 mL contrast material between August 2013 and September 2014. Group B underwent an additional standard multiphasic liver CT examination with 120 mL of contrast material (range, 70-143 mL). Image sets from triple arterial phase imaging were reconstructed from perfusion CT by fusing images from three dedicated arterial time points. Triple arterial phase CT and standard single arterial phase CT were compared by two readers, who assessed subjective image quality and HCC detection rate. A third reader served as reference reader and assessed objective image quality. The paired Student t test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic (JAFROC), and JAFROC curve were applied. Results The mean volume CT dose index was 11.6 mGy for triple arterial phase CT and 11.9 mGy for standard single arterial phase CT (P = .73). Triple arterial phase CT showed lower image noise and better contrast-to-noise ratio compared with standard single arterial phase CT (P < .001 and P = .032, respectively); however, there was no significant difference in lesion-to-liver-contrast ratio (P = .31). Subjective image quality was good for both protocols. The detection rate of the 65 HCC lesions was 82% for reader 1 and 83% for reader 2 at triple arterial phase CT and 80% for reader 1 and 77% for reader 2 at standard single arterial phase CT (P = .4). Conclusion Triple arterial phase imaging is feasible at the same radiation dose as that used for standard single arterial phase CT.

However, research examining the role of cultural dimensions has been largely unexplored. Drawing on the conservation of resources theory, we investigated whether the relationships between both quantitative job insecurity (i.e. the perceived threat of job loss) and qualitative job insecurity (i.e. the perceived threat of losing valued job features) and employee attitudes (job satisfaction and turnover intention) differ in culturally distinct regions. This was examined using representative employee samples from two regions of Switzerland which differ in societal practices uncertainty avoidance and performance orientation: the German-speaking (n = 966) and the French-speaking (n = 307) regions. Our research indicates that whereas the relationship between quantitative job insecurity and turnover intention is stronger in the French-speaking region where there is higher societal practice uncertainty avoidance, the relationship between qualitative job insecurity and job satisfaction is stronger in the German-speaking region where there is higher societal practice performance orientation.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/123020","predictions":"First, analyze the main topics: The abstract primarily focuses on the impact of job insecurity on employee attitudes, specifically exploring the differences in reactions to job insecurity in culturally distinct regions.

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:191915","TITLE":"Core stability and core selection in a decentralized labor matching market","ABSTRACT":"We propose a dynamic model of decentralized many-to-one matching in the context of a competitive labor market. Through wage offers and wage demands, firms compete over workers and workers compete over jobs. Firms make hire-and-fire decisions dependent on the wages of their own workers and on the alternative workers available on the job market. Workers bargain for better jobs; either individually or collectively as unions, adjusting wage demands upward\/downward depending on whether they are currently employed\/unemployed. We show that such a process is absorbed into the core with probability one in finite time. Moreover, within the core, allocations are selected that are characterized by surplus splitting according to a bargaining solution such that (i) firms and workforce share total revenue according to relative bargaining strengths, and (ii) workers receive equal workforce shares above their individual outside options. These results bridge empirical evidence and provide a rich set of testable predictions.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/191915","predictions":"First, analyze the main topics of the abstract:\n\nThe main topics of the abstract revolve around the modeling of a decentralized labor market, where firms and workers engage in a competitive process of wage offers and demands, leading to the formation of jobs and employment.

Despite this indisputable fact, it is a priori unclear how job search costs affect search duration and unemployment: lower search costs make it easier to find a job, reducing search duration and unemployment, but may also increase the reservation wage, increasing search duration and unemployment. I collaborate with a recruiting company to directly test the effects of lower search costs in a field experiment among approximately 400 IT professionals in Switzerland. I find that workers are more likely to search for detailed job information, but not to file a job application, when search costs are lower. These findings are consistent with an increase in the reservation wage.
