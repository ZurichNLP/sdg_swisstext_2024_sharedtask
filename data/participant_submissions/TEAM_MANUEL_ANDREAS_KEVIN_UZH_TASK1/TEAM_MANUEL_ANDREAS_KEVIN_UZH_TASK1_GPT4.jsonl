The role of the World Bank","ABSTRACT":"The World Bank is increasingly active in the area of climate change mitigation. While it justifies this engagement with its poverty reduction objective and its capacity to pave the way for new business activities in developing countries, critics blame the World Bank as a \u201cclimate profiteer\u201d and as an unfair competitor in private markets. Our econometric analysis of over 2,000 projects registered until May 2010 under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol allows us to compare the activities of the Bank with those of other, primarily private actors. The results indicate that hardly any of the CDM projects can be considered as strongly pro-poor. Nevertheless, in comparison to the rest of the CDM projects, the Bank\u2019s portfolio shows a relatively clearer orientation towards poor countries. Within these countries, however, the Bank does not show any particular pro-poor focus, and tends to implement those projects that are commercially most attractive. Moreover, there is no evidence of the Bank phasing out its activities once the market becomes fully operational, which goes against its professed pioneering and catalytic role in carbon markets.","SDG":13}

The example of the so-called \u2018Prosperity Gospel\u2019 in Africa","ABSTRACT":"Much of poverty alleviation theory and practice fails to sufficiently consider the following crucial factor: the religious dimension. This paper elaborates this thesis by focusing on the African context and the valuable resources African religious communities and movements can provide in the struggle against poverty. One particularly influential streak of present-time African religiousness serves as a case study: the so-called \u2018Prosperity Gospel\u2019 as part of Pentecostal Christianity. The author first argues for the continuing formative influence of religion on African conceptions of self, other, and world. Secondly, she provides a critical assessment of the impact of Pentecostalism and the \u2018Prosperity Gospel\u2019 on poverty alleviation. In comparison with secular ngos, Pentecostal churches emerge as the more effective agents of change. A third part situates the insights gained into a wider perspective, seeking ways to integrate the religious factor into a more holistic conception of and engagement against poverty.","SDG":1}

Rates of eligible individuals not receiving social transfers and ineligible individuals receiving them tend to be high, constraining the effectiveness of such anti-poverty programs. While interventions to incentivize or monitor local agents in charge of selecting beneficiaries are typically expensive, an important complementary and cost-effective approach could be to reform eligibility criteria to facilitate the selection of beneficiaries. Whether reforms should focus on reducing the number of rules, or selecting criteria which are easy to verify, or do both remains an unanswered question. We address this knowledge gap based on India\u2019s social pension scheme for elderly poor. We find that making eligibility criteria easier to verify has the potential to achieve a substantial improvement in the targeting performance through a reduction in the exclusion error. Those who meet the relevant criteria have a much higher chance of actually becoming beneficiaries. Since eligibility criteria can be changed at low cost, this suggests a viable route for reform in many developing countries. However, a major caveat remains that criteria must sufficiently well reflect actual poverty if the more accurate selection of beneficiaries according to formal criteria shall also translate into actual poverty reduction.","SDG":1}

Yet, despite numerous recent public and private initiatives to develop capacities  for agricultural innovation, such in itiatives are often not well aligned with national efforts to revive existing Agricultural Innovation Systems (AIS). In an effort to improve coordination and responsiveness of Capacity Development (CD) initiatives, the G20 Agriculture Ministers requested the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to lead the development of a Tropical Agricultural Platform (TAP), which is designed to improve coherence and coordination of CD for agricultural innovation in the tropics. This paper presents a summary of the results obtained from three regional needs assessments undertaken by TAP and its partners. The surveyed tropical  regions were Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Central America. The findings reveal a mismatch in all three regions between the external supply of primarily individual CD and the actual demand for institutional CD.  The misalignment might be addressed by strengthening south-south and triangular collaboration and by improving the institutional capacities that would render national AIS more demand-oriented and responsive to the needs of mallholders in domestic agriculture.","SDG":2}

Because body protein mass is controlled by the balance between synthesis and degradation, protein loss can occur as result of either increased breakdown, impaired synthesis, or both. Correction of acidosis may therefore help to maintain muscle mass and improve the health of patients with CMA. We evaluated whether alkalizing patients on hemodialysis might have a positive effect on protein synthesis and on nutritional parameters. METHODS: Eight chronic hemodialysis patients were treated daily with oral sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO(3)) supplementation for 10-14 days, yielding a pre-dialytic plasma bicarbonate concentration of 28.6 +\/-1.6 mmol\/l. The fractional synthesis rates (FSR) of muscle protein and albumin were obtained by the L-[(2)H(5)ring]phenylalanine flooding technique. RESULTS: Oral NaHCO(3 )supplementation induced a significant increase in serum bicarbonate (21.5 +\/- 3.4 vs. 28.6 +\/- 1.6 mmol\/l; p = 0.018) and blood pH (7.41 vs. 7.46; p = 0.041). The FSR of muscle protein and the FSR of albumin did not change significantly (muscle protein: 2.1 +\/- 0.2 vs. 2.0 +\/- 0.5% per day, p = 0.39; albumin: 8.3 +\/- 2.2 vs. 8.6 +\/- 2.5% per day, p = 0.31). Plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 1 decreased significantly (33.4 +\/- 21.3 vs. 25.4 +\/- 12.3 nmol\/l; p = 0.028), whereas thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxin and free triiodothyronine did not change significantly and nutritional parameters showed no improvement. CONCLUSION: In contrast to other findings, raising the blood pH of dialysis patients was not associated with a positive effect on albumin and muscle protein synthesis, or nutritional and endocrinal parameters.","SDG":0}

Coinfections commonly result from sequential exposure of hosts to different parasites. We argue that the sequential nature of coinfections is important for the consequences of infection in both natural and man-made environments. Coinfections accumulate during host lifespan, determining the structure of the parasite infracommunity. Interactions within the parasite community and their joint effect on the host individual potentially shape evolution of parasite life\u2010history traits and transmission biology.

A number of therapeutic options are available for patients with Stage III N2 NSCLC, including surgery [with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy (CTx)\/neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT)] or CRT potentially followed by adjuvant immunotherapy. We have no clear evidence demonstrating a significant survival benefit for either of these approaches, the selection between treatments is not always straightforward and can come down to physician and patient preference. The very heterogeneous definition of resectability of N2 disease makes the decision-making process even more complex.\r\nMethods: We evaluated the treatment strategies for preoperatively diagnosed stage III cN2 NSCLC among Swiss thoracic surgeons and radiation oncologists. Treatment strategies were converted into decision trees and analysed for consensus and discrepancies. We analysed factors relevant to decision-making within these recommendations.\r\nResults: For resectable \"non-bulky\" mediastinal lymph node involvement, there was a trend towards surgery. Numerous participants recommend a surgical approach outside existing guidelines as long as the disease was resectable, even in multilevel N2. With increasing extent of mediastinal nodal disease, multimodal treatment based on radiotherapy was more common.\r\nConclusions: Both, surgery- or radiotherapy-based treatment regimens are feasible options in the management of Stage III N2 NSCLC. The different opinions reflected in the results of this manuscript reinforce the importance of a multidisciplinary setting and the importance of shared decision-making with the patient.","SDG":0}

Significant variations may therefore exist regarding the choices of treatment, even among experts, which may confuse both the medical community and patients.\r\nMETHODS: Ten cases of CRLM with different levels of complexity were presented to 43 expert liver surgeons from 23 countries and 4 continents. Experts were defined as experienced surgeons with academic contributions to the field of liver tumors. Experts provided information on their medical education and current practice in liver surgery and transplantation. Using an online platform, they chose their strategy in treating each case from defined multiple choices with added comments. Inter-rater agreement among experts and cases was calculated using free-marginal multirater kappa methodology. A similar, but adjusted survey was presented to 60 general surgeons from Asia, Europe, and North America to test their attitude in treating or referring complex patients to expert centers.\r\nRESULTS: Thirty-eight (88%) experts completed the evaluation. Most of them are in leading positions (92%) with a median clinical experience of 25 years. Agreement on therapeutic strategies among them was none to minimal in more than half of the cases with kappa varying from 0.00 to 0.39. Many general surgeons may not refer the complex cases to expert centers, including in Europe, where they also engage in complex liver surgeries.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Considerable inconsistencies of decision-making exist among expert surgeons when choosing a therapeutic strategy for CRLM. This might confuse both patients and referring physicians and indicate that an international high-level consensus statements and widely accepted guidelines are needed.","SDG":0}

Increasingly, researchers and public health institutes use disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to generate a comprehensive comparison of the population health impact of these conditions. DALYs calculations, however, entail a number of methodological choices and assumptions, with data gaps and uncertainties to accommodate. Thisreview identifies existing brucellosis burden of disease studies and analyzes their methodological choices, assumptions, and uncertainties. It supports the Global Burden of Animal Diseases programme in the development of a systematic methodology to describe the impact of animal diseases on society, including human health.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods\/Principal findings\r\nA systematic search for brucellosis burden of disease calculations was conducted in pre-selected international and grey literature databases. Using a standardized reporting framework, we evaluated each estimate on a variety of key methodological assumptions necessary to compute a DALY. Fourteen studies satisfied the inclusion criteria (human brucellosis and quantification of DALYs). One study reported estimates at the global level, the rest were national or subnational assessments. Data regarding different methodological choices were extracted, including detailed assessments of the adopted disease models. Most studies retrieved brucellosis epidemiological data from administrative registries. Incidence data were often estimated on the basis of laboratory-confirmed tests. Not all studies included mortality estimates (Years of Life Lost) in their assessments due to lack of data or the assumption that brucellosis is not a fatal disease. Only two studies used a model with variable health states and corresponding disability weights. The rest used a simplified singular health state approach. Wide variation was seen in the duration chosen for brucellosis, ranging from 2 weeks to 4.5 years, irrespective of the whether a chronic state was included.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nAvailable brucellosis burden of disease assessments vary widely in their methodology and assumptions. Further research is needed to better characterize the clinical course of brucellosis and to estimate case-fatality rates. Additionally, reporting of methodological choices should be improved to enhance transparency and comparability of estimates. These steps will increase the value of these estimates for policy makers.","SDG":16}

Physicians were asked to identify key steps in the patient pathway relating to patient presentation, diagnosis and referral, in addition to other treatment and follow-up processes.\r\nResults: The interviewed physicians reported that late presentation with dcSSc was common, with some patients presenting to primary care physicians after symptoms had persisted for up to 1 year. Awareness of dcSSc is reported to vary widely among primary care physicians. Final diagnosis, generally following guideline-based recommendations, was by rheumatologists in most cases (or internal medicine physicians in France) and they remained responsible for global patient management, with lesser involvement in diagnosis and management by dermatologists. Specialist centres were not well defined and did not exist in all countries.\r\nConclusion: Patients and primary healthcare providers can be unaware of the symptoms of dcSSc, therefore presentation and referral to specialist care are often late. Thus, improved awareness among patients and primary care physicians is necessary to facilitate earlier referral and diagnosis. Once referred, more consistent use of the modified Rodnan skin score at diagnosis and follow-up may help to monitor disease progression. Furthermore, establishing specialist centres may help to promote such changes and improve patient care.","SDG":0}

The proposed vaccines contain several different vaccine active principles (VAP), such as inactivated virus, antigen, mRNA, and DNA, which are associated with either standard adjuvants or nanomaterials (NM) such as liposomes in Moderna's and BioNTech\/Pfizer's vaccines. COVID-19 vaccine adjuvants may be chosen among liposomes or other types of NM composed for example of graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes, micelles, exosomes, membrane vesicles, polymers, or metallic NM, taking inspiration from cancer nano-vaccines, whose adjuvants may share some of their properties with those of viral vaccines. The mechanisms of action of nano-adjuvants are based on the facilitation by NM of targeting certain regions of immune interest such as the mucus, lymph nodes, and zones of infection or blood irrigation, the possible modulation of the type of attachment of the VAP to NM, in particular VAP positioning on the NM external surface to favor VAP presentation to antigen presenting cells (APC) or VAP encapsulation within NM to prevent VAP degradation, and the possibility to adjust the nature of the immune response by tuning the physico-chemical properties of NM such as their size, surface charge, or composition. The use of NM as adjuvants or the presence of nano-dimensions in COVID-19 vaccines does not only have the potential to improve the vaccine benefit\/risk ratio, but also to reduce the dose of vaccine necessary to reach full efficacy. It could therefore ease the overall spread of COVID-19 vaccines within a sufficiently large portion of the world population to exit the current crisis.","SDG":0}

Based on the well-known retrieval structure model, the memory strength of phonemes and graphemes should be strengthened by visual and auditory associations between graphemes and phonemes. Using specifically designed training software, we examined whether establishing a multitude of visuo-auditory associations might help to mitigate writing errors in children with developmental dyslexia.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Forty-three children with developmental dyslexia and 37 carefully matched normal reading children performed a computer-based writing training (15-20 minutes 4 days a week) for three months with the aim to recode a sequential textual input string into a multi-sensory representation comprising visual and auditory codes (including musical tones). The study included four matched groups: a group of children with developmental dyslexia (n=20) and a control group (n=18) practiced with the training software in the first period (3 months, 15-20 minutes 4 days a week), while a second group of children with developmental dyslexia (n=23) (waiting group) and a second control group (n=19) received no training during the first period. In the second period the children with developmental dyslexia and controls who did not receive training during the first period now took part in the training.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Children with developmental dyslexia who did not perform computer-based training during the first period hardly improved their writing skills (post-pre improvement of 0-9%), the dyslexic children receiving training strongly improved their writing skills (post-pre improvement of 19-35%). The group who did the training during the second period also revealed improvement of writing skills (post-pre improvement of 27-35%). Interestingly, we noticed a strong transfer from trained to non-trained words in that the children who underwent the training were also better able to write words correctly that were not part of the training software. In addition, even non-impaired readers and writers (controls) benefited from this training.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Three-month of visual-auditory multimedia training strongly improved writing skills in children with developmental dyslexia and non-dyslexic children. Thus, according to the retrieval structure model, multi-sensory training using visual and auditory cues enhances writing performance in children with developmental dyslexia and non-dyslexic children.","SDG":4}

This increase has been linked to visual expertise for print, implying a protracted monotonic development. We investigated the development of coarse neural tuning for print by studying children longitudinally before and after learning to read, and comparing them to skilled adults. The coarse N1 tuning, which had been absent in nonreading kindergarten children, emerged in less than 2 years after the same children had mastered basic reading skills in 2nd grade. The N1 became larger for words than symbol strings in every child, and this coarse tuning was stronger for faster readers. Fast brain processes thus specialize rapidly for print when children learn to read, and play an important functional role in the fluency of early reading. Comparing 2nd graders with adults revealed a further decrease of the coarse N1 tuning in adults, presumably reflecting further reading practice. This constitutes a prominent nonlinear development of coarse neurophysiological specialization for print. The maximum tuning in novice readers possibly reflects the high sensitivity of their neural network for visual aspects of print, and a more selective tuning in expert adult readers.","SDG":0}

These codes represent information about letters and syllables of a word. An enhanced version, developed for this study, contains an additional phonological code and an improved word selection controller relying on a phoneme-based student model. We investigated the spelling behavior of children by means of learning curves based on log-file data of the previous and the enhanced software version. First, we compared the learning progress of children with dyslexia working either with the previous software (n\u2009=\u200928) or the adapted version (n\u2009=\u200937). Second, we investigated the spelling behavior of children with dyslexia (n\u2009=\u200937) and matched children without dyslexia (n\u2009=\u200925). To gain deeper insight into which factors are relevant for acquiring spelling skills, we analyzed the influence of cognitive abilities, such as attention functions and verbal memory skills, on the learning behavior. All investigations of the learning process are based on learning curve analyses of the collected log-file data. The results evidenced that those children with dyslexia benefit significantly from the additional phonological cue and the corresponding phoneme-based student model. Actually, children with dyslexia improve their spelling skills to the same extent as children without dyslexia and were able to memorize phoneme to grapheme correspondence when given the correct support and adequate training. In addition, children with low attention functions benefit from the structured learning environment. Generally, our data showed that memory sources are supportive cognitive functions for acquiring spelling skills and for using the information cues of a multi-modal learning environment.","SDG":4}

The ability to read, indispensable to perform in today's society, necessitates a reorganization of visual cortex for fast letter recognition, but the developmental course of this process has not yet been characterized. Here, we show the emergence of visual sensitivity to letters across five electroencephalography measurements from kindergarten and throughout elementary school and relate this development to emerging reading skills. We examined the visual N1, the electrophysiological correlate of ventral occipito-temporal cortex activation in 65 children at varying familial risk for dyslexia. N1 letter sensitivity emerged in first grade, when letter sound knowledge gains were most pronounced and decayed shortly after when letter knowledge is consolidated, showing an inverted U-shaped development. This trajectory can be interpreted within an interactive framework that underscores the influence of top-down predictions. While the N1 amplitudes to letters correlated with letter sound knowledge at the beginning of learning, no association between the early N1 letter response and later reading skills was found. In summary, the current findings provide an important reference point for our neuroscientific understanding of learning trajectories and the process of visual specialization during skill learning.","SDG":4}

This longitudinal study investigates how increasing second language proficiency influences activation differences during lexico-semantic processing of first and second language. Native English speaking exchange students learning German were examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging while reading words in three different languages at two points in time: at the beginning of their stay (day1) and 5 months later (day2), when second language proficiency had significantly increased. On day1, second language words evoked more frontal activation than words from the mother tongue. These differences were diminished on day2. We therefore conclude that with increasing second language proficiency, lexico-semantic processing of second language words needs less frontal control. Our results demonstrate that lexico-semantic processing of first and second language converges onto similar networks as second language proficiency increases.","SDG":0}

Gender Equality Policies in Japan since 2009","ABSTRACT":"After the change of government in 2009, many expected the new DPJ-led government to implement changes in Japanese society and politics. In the area of gender equality policies, new policymaking and implementation dynamics were anticipated. This paper aims at exploring the extent of policy change in the field of gender equality policies since the new government took office in 2009 by focusing on two policies that stood out on the agenda: the compilation of the Third Basic Plan for Gender Equality and the amendment of the Civil Code. In both cases, the prospects for policy change seemed similar, because the governing party was supposed to take up a more progressive stance towards gender equality, timing was fortunate, and the ministers in charge as well as Prime Minister Hatoyama were supporting policy change in these areas. Furthermore, lobbyists from within Japan and the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) Committee called on the Japanese government for action. The policy outcomes, however, turned out to be very different: While the Third Basic Plan for Gender Equality includes prominent new policy measures and is an example of visible policy change, plans for amending the Civil Code failed. The article argues that these differences are best explained by intraparty divisions over gender equality within the ruling DPJ which emerged especially since the party took over government.","SDG":5}

What follows is an engagement with arguments developed by Hanna Papanek and Carroll Pastner in this journal some decades ago. They both drew on fieldwork experiences in Pakistan to argue that foreign women fieldworkers can (sometimes) take advantage of ambiguities in the social structures of Purdah societies, that is, societies characterized by \u201csexual segregation and the seclusion of women\u201d (Pastner 1982:262), to flexibly position themselves and to be able to interact with both men and women.

It argues that possibilities for foreign women to get physical access to men\u2019s worlds, although still available, remain limited and in some ways have become more restricted (including access to women\u2019s worlds) due to political developments in recent decades. The paper also argues that, irrespective of the feasibility of physical access to other gender\u2019s worlds, it is necessary to reflect on subjectivities through which access to \u201cforeign\u201d worlds is mediated and knowledge is produced.","SDG":16}

The focus of the analysis is on discursive spaces that have been created for women engaged in non-domestic work. Starting from an interpretation of the existing academic literature, this paper argues that Pakistani women's non-domestic work has been conceptualised in three major ways: as a contribution to national development, as a danger to the nation, and as non-existent. The paper concludes that although some conceptualisations of work have been more powerful than others and, at specific historical junctures, have become part of concrete state policies, alternative conceptualisations have always existed alongside them. Disclosing the state's implication in the discursive construction of working women's identities might contribute to the destabilisation of hegemonic concepts of gendered divisions of labour in Pakistan.","SDG":16}

We therefore achieve a consistent description of s-tetrazine from the isolated molecule to full solvation in water. The explicit treatment of solvent molecules allows for an accurate treatment of solute-solvent interactions. For the isolated s-tetrazine molecule a comparison with earlier high level ab initio calculations and other density functional calculations is made. In accordance with experiment the most favorable two-water-adduct displays a homodromic feature, i.e., a chain of hydrogen bonding from the nitrogen of the s-tetrazine to its methenyl (CH) group. Radial distribution functions calculated from a Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulation of the aqueous solution clearly show an unexpected preference of water for hydrogen bonding to the C-H group over the nitrogen lone pairs. Only infrequent and short-lived hydrogen bonds from water molecules to the nitrogen atoms are found. Calculations of vertical excitations using time-dependent density functional theory showed that the solvent shifts can be explained from the polarization of the Kohn-Sham orbitals of the solute. Hydrogen bonding has only a minor effect on the solvent shifts of low lying states of s-tetrazine.","SDG":0}

Biotransformation, i.e., transformation by microbes, is well understood for a number of priority pollutants, but a similar level of understanding is lacking for many emerging contaminants encountered at low concentrations and in complex mixtures across natural and engineered systems. Any advanced approaches aiming to reduce environmental exposure to such contaminants (e.g., novel engineered biological water treatment systems, design of readily degradable chemicals, or improved regulatory assessment strategies to determine contaminant persistence a priori) will depend on understanding the causal links among contaminant removal, the key driving agents of biotransformation at low concentrations (i.e., relevant microbes and their metabolic activities), and how their presence and activity depend on environmental conditions. In this Perspective, we present the current understanding and recent methodological advances that can help to identify such links, even in complex environmental microbiomes and for contaminants present at low concentrations in complex chemical mixtures. We discuss the ensuing insights into contaminant biotransformation across varying environments and conditions and ask how much closer we have come to designing improved approaches to reducing environmental exposure to contaminants.","SDG":12}

We assess methodologies for projects distributing compact fluorescent lamps to households. The approval of the first large-scale methodology took more than 2 years and in the interaction with the regulatory bodies, the methodology became very cumbersome, especially regarding monitoring requirements. Four sample groups are required and the technology that has to be used for measuring utilization of CFLs does not yet exist.

Estimates published over the last decade diverge by up to four orders of magnitude \u2014 from 0.0064 kilowatt-hours per gigabyte (kWh\/GB) to 136 kWh\/GB. This article presents a review of the methodological approaches used so far in such assessments: i) top\u2013down analyses based on estimates of the overall Internet energy consumption and the overall Internet traffic, whereby average energy intensity is calculated by dividing energy by traffic for a given period of time, ii) model-based approaches that model all components needed to sustain an amount of Internet traffic, and iii) bottom\u2013up approaches based on case studies and generalization of the results. Our analysis of the existing studies shows that the large spread of results is mainly caused by two factors: a) the year of reference of the analysis, which has significant influence due to efficiency gains in electronic equipment, and b) whether end devices such as personal computers or servers are included within the system boundary or not. For an overall assessment of the energy needed to perform a specific task involving the Internet, it is necessary to account for the types of end devices needed for the task, while the energy needed for data transmission can be added based on a generic estimate of Internet energy intensity for a given year. Separating the Internet as a data transmission system from the end devices leads to more accurate models and to results that are more informative for decision makers, because end devices and the networking equipment of the Internet usually belong to different spheres of control.","SDG":7}

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:193890","TITLE":"Event-Based Angular Velocity Regression with Spiking Networks","ABSTRACT":"Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are bio-inspired networks that process information conveyed as temporal spikes rather than numeric values. An example of a sensor providing such data is the event-camera. It only produces an event when a pixel reports a significant brightness change. Similarly, the spiking neuron of an SNN only produces a spike whenever a significant number of spikes occur within a short period of time. Due to their spike-based computational model, SNNs can process output from event-based, asynchronous sensors without any pre-processing at extremely lower power unlike standard artificial neural networks. This is possible due to specialized neuromorphic hardware that implements the highly-parallelizable concept of SNNs in silicon. Yet, SNNs have not enjoyed the same rise of popularity as artificial neural networks. This not only stems from the fact that their input format is rather unconventional but also due to the challenges in training spiking networks. Despite their temporal nature and recent algorithmic advances, they have been mostly evaluated on classification problems. We propose, for the first time, a temporal regression problem of numerical values given events from an event-camera. We specifically investigate the prediction of the 3- DOF angular velocity of a rotating event-camera with an SNN. The difficulty of this problem arises from the prediction of angular velocities continuously in time directly from irregular, asynchronous event-based input. Directly utilising the output of event-cameras without any pre-processing ensures that we inherit all the benefits that they provide over conventional cameras. That is high-temporal resolution, high-dynamic range and no motion blur. To assess the performance of SNNs on this task, we introduce a synthetic event-camera dataset generated from real-world panoramic images and show that we can successfully train an SNN to perform angular velocity regression.","SDG":0}

The interaction between multiple such green capabilities when deployed simultaneously, as well as potential interactions with other existing functionality such as quality of service functions, need to be managed transparently by the operators. We developed SLIM, the SustainabiLity Information Model for Energy Efficiency Policies, as an addon to the IETF Policy Core Information Model Extension to allow unifying the management of green capabilities throughout the network. We illustrate the flexibility of our approach by presenting a use case and describing an energy management system where SLIM was used.","SDG":7}

We use the administrative personnel records of a long balanced panel of blue-collar workers from a manufacturing firm in Germany with a distinct classification of wage groups and unique information on workers\u2019 productivity in form of suggestions for productivity improvement. Using robust locally weighted regression, our main findings suggest that the probability of promotion is highest for younger workers and early in the career. Older workers are less likely to be promoted. The likelihood of making a rewarded suggestion is inversely u-shaped with respect to tenure and age. Furthermore, workers\u2019 ability and firm-specific human capital determine the workers\u2019 careers and productivity.","SDG":8}

Drawing on Lazear\u2019s skill-weights approach, we develop empirical measures for occupational specificity and the skill distance between occupations to investigate how skills map into job mobility and wages. Our analysis reveals several important insights. First, higher occupational specificity is associated with lower job mobility and a longer period of unemployment. However, it is also associated with higher wages. Workers receive a wage premium of about 9% for re-employment in a one standard deviation more specific occupation. These results suggest a risk\u2013return trade-off to educational investments into more specific skills. Second, the skill distance is negatively associated with wages. Workers moving between occupations with similar skill requirements suffer smaller wage losses than those with more distant moves. Thus, skills appear to be transferable across occupations and to play a pivotal role in the determination of wages.","SDG":4}

Job creation entails fixed costs, but existing jobs are subject to diminishing returns. We characterize the equilibrium in the de-regulated economy where firms and individual workers freely negotiate wages and hours. Then, we consider the effects of a legislation restricting the maximum working time, while we let wages respond endogenously. Employment effects are sensitive to the representation of preferences. In our benchmark, small reductions in working time, starting from the laissez-faire equilibrium solution, always result in a small increase in the equilibrium employment, while larger reductions reduce employment. The regulation benefits workers, both unemployed and employed (even if wages decrease and even in cases where employment falls), but reduces profits and output.","SDG":8}

We analyse, how a decline in trade costs affects outsourcing activities and the production structure in the small economy. A stimulation of cross-border outsourcing raises wage dispersion and, if labour markets are unionized, also the employment of high-skilled relative to low-skilled labour. Using a panel of Austrian industries, we find, first, that decreasing trade barriers - as observed after the fall of the Iron Curtain - indeed stimulate outsourcing to Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and, second, that outsourcing to these countries significantly shifts relative employment in favour of high-skilled labour.","SDG":8}

The former represents the most obvious 'vertical' dimension of changing job requirements, whereas the latter, no less important in a highly segmented labor market, reflects the 'horizontal' differentiation along occupational lines. We argue that two sources are responsible for any change in the aggregate composition of skill demand: The shifting sectoral composition of the economy and the intra-sectoral adaptations related to new technologies and the changing work organization. Against this background, we assess the relative impact of inter-and intra-sectoral change on the long-term trends in skill demand. We apply novel indicators of technological change within sectors to account for the latter. The empirical analyses are based on a representative random sample of job ads published between 1950 and the year 2000 in the German-speaking part of Switzerland.","SDG":4}

Evidence from a Natural Field Experiment","ABSTRACT":"Employment contracts are often incomplete, leaving many responsibilities subject to workers\u2019 discretion. High work morale is therefore essential for sustaining voluntary cooperation and high productivity in firms. We conducted a field experiment to test whether workers reciprocate wage cuts and raises with low or high work productivity. Wage cuts had a detrimental and persistent impact on productivity, reducing average output by more than 20 percent. An equivalent wage increase, however, did not result in any productivity gains. The results from an additional control experiment with high monetary performance incentives demonstrate that workers could still produce substantially more output, leaving enough room for positive reactions. Altogether, these results provide evidence consistent with a model of reciprocity, as opposed to inequality aversion.","SDG":10}

A subgroup of agents (roughly one third) is willing to do so even if this option is more costly than choosing the alternative job. Moreover, we find that these subjects provide substantially higher effort. These results suggest that some workers can be motivated by missions and that selection into mission-oriented organizations is an important factor to explain empirical findings of lower wages and high motivation in these organizations.","SDG":0}

Our results generally confirm existing studies in that we find that a spell of self-employment is associated with lower hourly wages compared to workers who were consecutively wage-employed. We also show, however, that this effect disappears\u2014and even becomes positive in some settings\u2014for formerly self-employed who find dependent employment in the same sector as their self-employment sector. Hence, the on average negative effect of self-employment is rather caused by sector switching than by the self-employment experience per se. Moreover, formerly self-employed who either enjoyed a high income or hired at least one worker during their self-employment spell receive wages in subsequent dependent employment that are at least as high as for individuals who have been consecutively wage-employed.","SDG":1}

Studies have considered both responsive and proactive customer orientation. Competitor orientation, however, has been investigated more narrowly. Research has focused specifically on its responsive dimension, a firm's posture of quickly responding to its competitors' actions and their offerings; but has largely disregarded proactive competitor orientation, a firm's posture towards altering the market's competitive behavior in its favor. This study investigates the role of responsive and proactive competitor orientation on influencing innovation and firm performance, as well as the mediating effects of technology and learning orientation. Utilizing a unique dataset that combines primary and time-lagged secondary data from 306 firms, we find that both responsive and proactive competitor orientation are observable drivers of performance in the market, but in notably different ways. Proactive competitor orientation drives innovation performance, directly and through technology orientation. Responsive competitor orientation, instead, enhances firm performance through learning orientation. By providing insights about the proactive side of competitor orientation, this study supplements and completes the so called \u201cmarket orientation matrix\u201d.

Drawing on a year-long ethnographic study of a start-up company in the pharmaceutical industry, we show that talk supports the enactment of collective reflection by enabling the participants to (1) name and situate the issue to be discussed with regard to the performative and ostensive aspects of the routine, (2) jointly envisage and explore alternative ways of enacting the routine, and (3) evaluate and question these suggestions from different angles. We examine how these aspects of reflective talk play out in different types of routine change and how the progressive unfolding of the talk reveals distinct opportunities for routine change. With our findings, we shed light on the role of collective reflection in routine change, on variation and selective retention in routine change, and on how organizational members balance the need for consistency and change in the enactment of routines.","SDG":16}

The model is based on two longitudinal case studies of large corporations operating in the information and communication technology sector in Europe. At the core of this model are learning processes that enable the firm to build up an external corporate venturing capability, by utilizing learning strategies both within and outside venturing relationships. To build this new capability, firms engage in acquisitive learning. Critical to deepening the capability acquired is adaptation of all knowledge to the firm specific context through experiential learning mechanisms.

These models may be used to generate representations of the future (imagination) and the past (episodic memory). In this paper we will explore some problems surrounding the representation of the present arising from the use of such models in the artificial cognitive system under development within the ECCEROBOT project. There are two aspects to consider: the representation of the state of the robot\u2019s body within the self model, and the representation of the state of the external world within the world model. In both natural and robotic systems, the processing of the sensory data carrying state information takes a considerable time, and so any estimates of the present states of both the agent and the world would have to be obtained by using predictive models. However, it appears that there is no need for any such representations to be generated in the course of selecting a course of action using self and world models, since representations are only of the future or the past. This may call into question the utility and timing of the apparent perception of the present in humans.","SDG":0}

Drawing on the needs-based model and the common-ingroup identity model, we hypothesized that the experience of accepting intergroup contact and the endorsement of a dual identity representation of intergroup relations would be associated with greater support for equality. Furthermore, integrating the logic of both models, we tested the novel hypothesis that the positive effect of accepting contact on support for equality would be stronger under a high (vs. low) dual identity representation. While the predicted main effects received empirical support, we found no evidence for the expected interaction. These findings suggest that interventions to foster support for social change among advantaged group members can promote accepting contact and a dual identity representation independently of each other.","SDG":10}

We show that a \u2018leveller\u2019 strategy, which punishes hawkishness in the hawk\u2013dove game with defection in the prisoner\u2019s dilemma, can be evolutionarily stable provided that the gains from cooperation are high relative to the benefits of hawkishness.

How can we explain this increase in inequalities? Policies in labor markets, social policy, and political representation are strongly linked in the creation, widening, and deepening of insider-outsider divides\u2014a process known as dualization. While it is certainly not the only driver of increasing inequality, the encompassing nature of its development across multiple domains makes dualization one of the most important current trends affecting developed societies. However, the extent and forms of dualization vary greatly across countries. The comparative perspective of this book provides insights into why Nordic countries witness lower levels of insider-outsider divides, whereas in continental, liberal and southern welfare states, they are more likely to constitute a core characteristic of the political economy. Most importantly, the comparisons presented in this book point to the crucial importance of politics and political choice in driving and shaping the social outcomes of deindustrialization. While increased structural labor market divides can be found across all countries, governments have a strong responsibility in shaping the distributive consequences of these labor market changes. Insider-outsider divides are not a straightforward consequence of deindustrialization, but rather the result of political choice.","SDG":10}

Restoration of these aspects of groups\u2019 identities can unlock the potential for collective action among members of disadvantaged groups and for a greater willingness to change the status quo toward equality among members of advantaged groups. A major theoretical implication of these findings is that social psychological theorizing should pay greater attention to morally based motivations as critical factors in the facilitation of change. A prime practical implication is that interventions designed to improve intergroup relations should consider not only acceptance-related but also agency-related motivations (e.g., through a \u201ccommon stigmatizers identity\u201d re-categorization strategy).","SDG":16}

Even though urban areas and respective agglomerations have continuously gained in importance in Switzerland to this day, the Swiss national population census will no longer include commuter data at high spatial resolution. Hence, the definition of the rapidly evolving urban agglomeration concept will have to be modified for future urban research and planning purposes.\r\nWe propose a crowdsourcing approach to overcome this data gap, and employ the open and web-based Wikipedia encyclopedia as a new resource to delineate agglomeration areas. Using the North Eastern parts of Switzerland in this case study, we systematically evaluate whether user-generated content can serve as an option to fill the commuter data gap in future Swiss national population censuses to define agglomeration areas. In a second step, we evaluate the influence of potential edge effects on our chosen approach.\r\nWe employ the number of hyperlinks in the Wikipedia database to quantify the strength of functional relationships between municipalities appearing in the Wikipedia encyclopedia. Next, we visualize the extracted municipality network structure for the chosen study area. Finally, we cluster the connected municipalities to agglomeration zones, and compare the computed municipality clusters with the agglomeration areas currently defined by the Swiss census.\r\nOur results suggest that the aggregation structure of our crowdsourcing approach is congruent with the officially developed agglomeration areas proposed by the Swiss census. Crowdsourced data thus might be an additional future data resource to complement more traditional census statistics for space districting purposes or socio-economic research in urban geography and planning.\r\nHowever, our results also suggest that geographic space indeed influences even non-spatially organized, crowdsourced encyclopedic entries, and this must be systematically studied further in future studies.\r\nEnglish Title: Agglomerations newly defined with crowdsourced data: visualizing North Eastern Switzerland based on Wikipedia content.","SDG":11}

Traffic events are related to traffic accidents, congestion, parking issues, to name a few. Currently, traffic events are detected through static sensors e.g., CCTV camera, loop detectors. However they have limited spatial coverage and high maintenance cost, especially in developing regions. On the other hand, with Web 2.0 and ubiquitous mobile platforms, people can act as social sensors sharing different traffic events along with their locations. We investigated whether Twitter - a social media platform can be useful to understand urban traffic events from tweets in India. However, such tweets are informal and noisy and containing vernacular geographical information making the location retrieval task challenging. So far most authors have used geotagged tweets to identify traffic events which accounted for only 0.1%-3% or sometimes less than that. Recently Twitter has removed precise geotagging, further decreasing the utility of such approaches. To address these issues, this research explored how ungeotagged tweets could be used to understand traffic events in India. We developed a novel framework that does not only categorize traffic related tweets but also extracts the locations of the traffic events from the tweet content in Greater Mumbai. The results show that an SVM based model performs best detecting traffic related tweets. While extracting location information, a hybrid georeferencing model consists of a supervised learning algorithm and a number of spatial rules outperforms other models.

Land-cover products derived from historical aerial orthomosaics acquired decades ago can provide important evidence to inform long-term studies. To reduce the manual labelling effort by human experts and to scale to large, meaningful regions, we investigate in this study how domain adaptation techniques and deep learning can help to efficiently map land cover in Central Africa. We propose and evaluate a methodology that is based on unsupervised adaptation to reduce the cost of generating reference data for several cities and across different dates. We present the first application of domain adaptation based on fully convolutional networks for semantic segmentation of a dataset of historical panchromatic orthomosaics for land-cover generation for two focus cities Goma-Gisenyi and Bukavu. Our experimental evaluation shows that the domain adaptation methods can reach an overall accuracy between 60% and 70% for different regions. If we add a small amount of labelled data from the target domain, too, further performance gains can be achieved.","SDG":11}

In this study we screened 5000 mini-Tn5 transposon insertion mutants of Burkholderia cenocepacia H111 for loss of cadmium tolerance. Of the four genes identified three affected outer membrane biogenesis and integrity or DNA repair. The fourth gene, BCAE0587, encoded a P1-type ATPase belonging to the CadA family of HM exporters. CadA-deficient strains lost the ability to grow in the presence of cadmium, zinc and lead, whereas resistance to nickel, copper and cobalt was not affected. Expression studies using a transcriptional fusion of the cadA promoter to gfp confirmed this specificity, as induction was only observed in presence of cadmium, zinc and lead. The promoter activity was found to be highest at neutral pH with an activation threshold of 30\u2009nM cadmium. Inoculation of the HM-hyperaccumulating plant Arabidopsis halleri with a RFP-marked derivative of B.\u2009cenocepacia H111 containing the PcadA\u2013gfp fusion demonstrated the applicability of this biosensor for monitoring cadmium at the single cell level in a natural environment.","SDG":0}

However, their measurement according to regulatory testing guidelines is laborious and costly. Despite the obvious ecological and economic benefits of knowing environmental degradability as early as possible, its consideration in the early phases of rational chemical design is therefore challenging. Here, we explore the possibility to use half-lives determined in highly time- and work-efficient biotransformation experiments with activated sludge and mixtures of chemicals to predict soil half-lives from regulatory simulation studies. We experimentally determined half-lives for 52 structurally diverse agrochemical active ingredients in batch reactors with three concentrations of the same activated sludge. We then developed bi- and multivariate models for predicting half-lives in soil by regressing the experimentally determined half-lives in activated sludge against average soil half-lives of the same chemicals extracted from regulatory data. The models differed in how we accounted for sorption-related bioavailability differences in soil and activated sludge. The best-performing models exhibited good coefficients of determination (R2 of around 0.8) and low average errors (<factor of 3 in half-life predictions) and were robust in cross-validation. From a practical perspective, these results suggest that it may indeed be possible to read across from half-lives determined in highly efficient biotransformation experiments in activated sludge to soil half-lives, which are obtained from much more work- and resource-intense regulatory studies, and that these predictions are clearly superior to predictions based on the output of BIOWIN, a publicly available quantitative structure-biodegradation relationship (QSBR) model. From a theoretical perspective, these results suggest that soil and activated sludge microbial communities, although certainly different in terms of taxonomic composition, may be functionally similar with respect to the enzymatic transformation of environmentally relevant concentrations of a diverse range of chemical compounds.","SDG":12}

This article presents a comprehensive life cycle assessment comparison of four different lighting technologies: the tungsten lamp, the halogen lamp, the conventional fluorescent lamp and the compact fluorescent lamp. Taking advantage of the most up-to-date life cycle inventory database available (ecoinvent data version 2.01), all life cycle phases were assessed and the sensitivity of the results for varying assumptions analysed: different qualities of compact fluorescent lamps (production phase), different electricity mixes (use phase), and endof- life scenarios for WEEE recycling versus municipal solid waste incineration (disposal phase). A functional unit of \u201cone hour of lighting\u201d was defined and the environmental burdens for the whole life cycle for all four lamp types were calculated, showing a clearly lower impact for the two gas-discharge lamps, i.e. the fluorescent and the compact fluorescent lamp. Differences in the product quality of the compact fluorescent lamps reveal to have only a very small effect on the overall environmental performance of this lamp type; a decline of the actual life time of this lamp type doesn't result in a change of the rank order of the results of the here examined four lamp types. It was also shown that the environmental break-even point of the gasdischarge lamps is reached long before the end of their expected life-span. All in all, it can be concluded that a change from today's tungsten lamp technology to a low-energy-consuming technology such as the compact fluorescent lamp results in a substantial environmental benefit.","SDG":12}

Producing MIEDs requires resources, energy and causes considerable emissions. Extending the service life MIEDs could significantly reduce the demand for new devices and associated environmental impacts. However, whether service life extension actually reduces environmental impacts associated with MIEDs is still uncertain. First, available life cycle assessments of MIEDs suggest that the production of integrated circuits (ICs) accounts for the majority of GHG emissions during the production phase and that greenhouse gas emissions increase with the size of the device and, more importantly, with its storage capacity. However, there is only little information available on MIED specific components such as logic or memory type integrated circuits. In order to quantify environmental impacts of service life extension of MIEDs new approaches for life cycle inventory modelling (e.g. modular modelling) are required. Second, service life-extending measures are subject to rebound effects, which occur if the number of devices being produced does not fall as expected. Such effects depend on consumer behaviour (e.g. re-spending effects) and the rationalities of involved economic actors. Thus, environmental, behavioural and economic aspects have tobe taken into account in order to develop service life-extending measures that entail environmental benefits while being both economically viable and appealing to consumers.","SDG":12}

Here, we studied the ichthyoarchaeological remains (i.e., cranial\/postcranial bones, otoliths, and teeth, among others) at 13 shellmounds on the southern coast of the state of Rio de Janeiro, which are located in coastal landscapes, including a sandy plain with coastal lagoons, rocky islands, islets and rocky bays. We identified patterns of similarity between shellmounds based on fish diversity, the ages of the assemblages, littoral geomorphology and prehistoric fisheries. Our new radiocarbon dating, based on otolith samples, was used for fishery characterization over time. A taxonomical study of the ichthyoarchaeological remains includes a diversity of 97 marine species, representing 37% of all modern species (i.e., 265 spp.) that have been documented along the coast of Rio de Janeiro state. This high fish diversity recovered from the shellmounds is clear evidence of well-developed prehistoric fishery activity that targeted sharks, rays and finfishes in a productive area influenced by coastal marine upwelling. The presence of adult and neonate shark, especially oceanic species, is here interpreted as evidence of prehistoric fisheries capacity for exploitation and possibly overexploitation in nursery areas. Various tools and strategies were used to capture finfish in seasonal fisheries, over rocky reef bottoms and in sandy littoral environments. Massive catches of whitemouth croaker, main target dermersal species of South Atlantic coast, show evidence of a reduction in body size of approximately 28% compared with modern fisheries. Fishery activity involving vulnerable species, especially in nursery areas, could mark the beginning of fish depletion along the southeastern Brazilian coast and the collapse of natural fish populations.","SDG":14}

This study determines changes in benthic community following this bleaching event at a remote UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Western Indian Ocean. Aldabra Atoll offers a rare opportunity to study global impacts in the absence of local anthropogenic stressors. Analysis of satellite-derived temperature data indicated that Aldabra was exposed to the highest bleaching-risk intensity of the past 20 years during this bleaching event. Bleaching-risk conditions lasted from December 2015 to June 2016 close to the 4 \u00b0C-week threshold, when bleaching is expected. Benthic cover was established pre- and post-bleaching from 21 transects across two reef locations (lagoonal reef, 2 m depth; seaward reef, 5 and 15 m depth). From a pre-bleaching benthic community in which living corals and epilithic algal matrix (EAM) predominated, Aldabra\u2019s reefs switched to an EAM-dominated community 8 months after bleaching. Soft corals declined by 93% of their overall pre-bleaching cover to \\ 1%. Although overall hard-coral cover was also reduced, the decline varied among depths and might indicate local adaptations of the lagoonal reef, due to greater variability in sea surface temperature compared to the seaward reef. With the exception of Isopora palifera, all taxomorphic coral groups experienced a decline following bleaching. Overall, Rhytisma experienced a near-complete extirpation, Acroporids (excluding I. palifera) and branching Poritids declined by more than 80%, Merulinidae lost ca. 60% of their pre-bleaching cover, while massive Poritids cover slightly decreased.

In this study, we applied an ensemble species distribution modelling approach, combining results of six modelling algorithms to identify areas of high probability of occurrence of the globally Vulnerable Australian humpback dolphin in northern Ningaloo Marine Park (NMP), north-western Australia. Model outputs were based on sighting data collected during systematic, boat-based surveys between 2013 and 2015, and in relation to various ecogeographic variables.

Areas of high probability (>\u20090.6) of dolphin occurrence were primarily (90%) in multiple use areas where extractive human activities are permitted, and were poorly represented in sanctuary (no-take) zones.

Considerable economic development is expected in particularly for tourism, navigation and aquaculture. However, in recent years the environmental quality of the Bay has been degraded by human activities and impacts. Even though the conditions of the Bay are monitored with in-situ measurements in a marine station, the environmental data, measured only in half-yearly intervals, are not sufficient for comprehensively assessing environmental quality at various temporal and spatial scales.\r\nTherefore, it is necessary to seek for complementary data sources to assess, control and manage the marine\r\nenvironment of Nha Trang Bay. We conducted three field trips in Nha Trang Bay at 23 stations, including 6 off-shore stations that are not influenced by freshwater from land, and measured the distribution of marine optical properties. These properties include the light extinction coefficient (K) of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the surface layer (i.e. 1m depth) and in water columns. K ranged from 0.099 m-1 off-shore to 0.409 m-1 in coastal waters. In addition, light absorption at various wavelengths were used to assess the concentration of chlorophyll-a, total suspended sediments and primary production. Further, we collected and used spatially explicit data using the OC4 method and the method of band 1, 2 and 3 ratios of the Landsat TM satellite. A data comparison confirms a significant correlation between the different sources of in-situ and remotely sensed data of light absorption. However, the predicted values at stations with a water depth of less than 5 m are significantly affected by sea bottom reflection of, for example, mud, sand, coral reefs and algae.\r\nThe results indicate that it is appropriate to use remote sensing methods to derive spatially explicit distributed variables of optical properties and derived products for an environmental assessment of coastal waters.","SDG":14}

A key factor distinguishing among agroforests is land-use history - whether agroforests are established inside forests or on historically forested but currently open lands. The disparity between land-use histories means the appropriate biodiversity baselines may differ, which should be accounted for when assessing the conservation value of agroforests. Specifically, comparisons between multiple baselines in forest and open land could enrich understanding of species' responses by contextualizing them. We made such comparisons based on data from a recently published meta-analysis of the effects of cocoa (Theobroma cacao) agroforestry on bird diversity. We regrouped rustic, mixed shade cocoa, and low shade cocoa agroforests, based on land-use history, into forest-derived and open-land-derived agroforests and compared bird species diversity (species richness, abundance, and Shannon's index values) between forest and open land, which represented the 2 alternative baselines. Bird diversity was similar in forest-derived agroforests and forests (Hedges' g* estimate [SE] = -0.3144 [0.3416], p = 0.36). Open-land-derived agroforests were significantly less diverse than forests (g* = 1.4312 [0.6308], p = 0.023) and comparable to open lands (g* = -0.1529 [0.5035], p = 0.76). Our results highlight how land-use history determined the conservation value of cocoa agroforests. Forest-derived cocoa agroforests were comparable to the available - usually already degraded - forest baselines, but entail future degradation risks. In contrast, open-land-derived cocoa agroforestry may offer restoration opportunities. Our results showed that comparisons among multiple baselines may inform relative contributions of agroforestry systems to bird conservation on a landscape scale.\r\n\r\nKeywords: agrobosque derivado de bosque; agrobosque derivado de campo abierto; agroecology; agroecolog\u00eda; cacao; conservaci\u00f3n; conservation; degradaci\u00f3n forestal; forest degradation; forest-derived agroforest; meta-analysis; open-land-derived agroforest; ornithology; ornitolog\u00eda; review; \u4fdd\u62a4; \u53ef\u53ef; \u6765\u81ea\u5f00\u9614\u5730\u7684\u519c\u6797\u3001\u9e1f\u7c7b\u5b66; \u6765\u81ea\u68ee\u6797\u7684\u519c\u6797; \u68ee\u6797\u9000\u5316; \u7efc\u8ff0; \u835f\u8403\u5206\u6790.","SDG":15}

Given that not all species are equally threatened and that resources are always limited, establishing robust prioritisation schemes is critical for implementing effective conservation actions. To this end, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species has become a widely used source of information on species\u2019 extinction risk. Various metrics have been proposed that combine IUCN status with different aspects of biodiversity to identify conservation priorities. However, current strategies do not take full advantage of palaeontological data, with conservation palaeobiology often focussing on the near-time fossil record (the last 2 million years). Here, we make a case for the value of the deep-time (over 2 million years ago), as it can offer tangible parallels with today\u2019s biodiversity crisis and inform on the intrinsic traits that make species prone to extinction. As such, palaeontological data holds great predictive power, which could be harnessed to flag species likely to be threatened but that are currently too poorly known to be identified as such. Finally, we identify key IUCN-based prioritisation metrics and outline opportunities for integrating palaeontological data to validate their implementation. Although the human signal of the current extinction crisis makes direct comparisons with the geological past challenging, the deep-time fossil record has more to offer to conservation than is currently recognised.","SDG":15}

Drastic loss in genetic diversity at such loci constitutes an extinction risk and should be monitored in species of conservation concern. However, effective implementations of genome-wide immune polymorphism sets into high-throughput genotyping assays are scarce. Here, we report the design and validation of a microfluidics-based amplicon sequencing assay to comprehensively capture genetic variation in Alpine ibex (Capra ibex). This species represents one of the most successful large mammal restorations recovering from a severely depressed census size and a massive loss in diversity at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). We analysed 65 whole-genome sequencing sets of the Alpine ibex and related species to select the most representative markers and to prevent primer binding failures. In total, we designed ~1,000 amplicons densely covering the MHC, further immunity-related genes as well as randomly selected genome-wide markers for the assessment of neutral population structure. Our analysis of 158 individuals shows that the genome-wide markers perform equally well at resolving population structure as RAD-sequencing or low-coverage genome sequencing data sets. Immunity-related loci show unexpectedly high degrees of genetic differentiation within the species. Such information can now be used to define highly targeted individual translocations.

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:216988","TITLE":"Solutions for humanity on how to conserve insects","ABSTRACT":"The fate of humans and insects intertwine, especially through the medium of plants. Global environmental change, including land transformation and contamination, is causing concerning insect diversity loss, articulated in the companion review Scientists' warning to humanity on insect extinctions. Yet, despite a sound philosophical foundation, recognized ethical values, and scientific evidence, globally we are performing poorly at instigating effective insect conservation. As insects are a major component of the tapestry of life, insect conservation would do well to integrate better with overall biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. This also involves popularizing insects, especially through use of iconic species, through more media coverage, and more inclusive education. Insect conservationists need to liaise better with decision makers, stakeholders, and land managers, especially at the conceptually familiar scale of the landscape. Enough evidence is now available, and synthesized here, which illustrates that multiple strategies work at local levels towards saving insects. We now need to expand these locally-crafted strategies globally. Tangible actions include ensuring maintenance of biotic complexity, especially through improving temporal and spatial heterogeneity, functional connectivity, and metapopulation dynamics, while maintaining unique habitats, across landscape mosaics, as well as instigating better communication. Key is to have more expansive sustainable agriculture and forestry, improved regulation and prevention of environmental risks, and greater recognition of protected areas alongside agro-ecology in novel landscapes. Future-proofing insect diversity is now critical, with the benefits far reaching, including continued provision of valuable ecosystem services and the conservation of a rich and impressive component of Earth's biodiversity.","SDG":15}

Commercial forestry is the greatest threat to biodiversity in boreal forests. Forestry practices have degraded most available habitat, threatening the persistence of natural populations. Understanding population responses is, therefore, critical for their conservation. Population viability analyses are effective tools to predict population persistence under forestry management. However, quantifying the mechanisms driving population responses is complex as population dynamics vary temporally and spatially. Metapopulation dynamics are governed by local dynamics and spatial factors, potentially mediating the impacts of forestry e.g., through dispersal. Here, we performed a seasonal, spatially explicit population viability analysis, using long-term data from a group-living territorial bird (Siberian jay, Perisoreus infaustus). We quantified the effects of forest management on metapopulation dynamics, via forest type-specific demography and spatially explicit dispersal, and how forestry impacted the stability of metapopulation dynamics. Forestry reduced metapopulation growth and stability, through negative effects on reproduction and survival. Territories in higher quality natural forest contributed more to metapopulation dynamics than managed forests, largely through demographic processes rather than dispersal. Metapopulation dynamics in managed forest were also less resilient to disturbances and consequently, may be more vulnerable to environmental change. Seasonal differences in source-sink dynamics observed in managed forest, but not natural forests, were caused by associated seasonal differences in dispersal. As shown here, capturing seasonal source-sink dynamics allows us to predict population persistence under human disturbance and to provide targeted conservation recommendations.","SDG":15}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:208601","TITLE":"On Lies and Hard Truths","ABSTRACT":"We run an experimental study using sender-receiver games to evaluate how senders' willingness to lie to others compares to their willingness to tell hard truths, i.e., promote an outcome that the sender knows is unfair to the receiver without explicitly lying. Unlike in previous work on lying when it has consequences, we do not find that antisocial behavior is less frequent when it involves lying than when it does not. In fact, we find the opposite result in the setting where there is social contact between senders and receivers, and receivers have enough information to judge whether they have been treated unfairly. In this setting, we find that senders prefer to hide behind a lie and implement the antisocial outcome by being dishonest rather than by telling the truth. These results are consistent with social image costs depending on the social proximity between senders and receivers, especially when receivers can judge the kindness of the senders' actions.","SDG":0}

The mediatization of politics is defined as a long-term process through which the importance of the media and their spill-over effects on political processes, institutions, organizations, and actors has increased. Four dimensions can be distinguished in this process, related to the importance of media as source of information about politics and society, the autonomy of media institutions from other social and political institutions, and the extent to which media content and political institutions, organizations, and actors respectively are guided by media logic or political logic. Both media logic and political logic are conceptualized as three-dimensional concepts. While media logic is conceptualized as shaped by professionalism, commercialism, and media technology, political logic is conceptualized as shaped by polity, policy, and politics. The chapter also analyzes the concepts of media influence and media effects within the context of the mediatization of politics. The chapter concludes by identifying five challenges for further theory and research on the mediatization of politics.","SDG":16}

Yet this debate overlooks the influence of the broader societal context on organizational behavior. In this article, we argue that misbehaviors of organizations (the 'barrels') and their members (the 'apples') cannot be addressed properly without a clear understanding of their broader context (the 'larder').\r\nWhereas previously, a strong societal framework dampened the practical application of the Homo economicus concept (business actors as perfectly rational and egocentric utility-maximizing agents without any moral concern), specialization, individualization, and globalization led to a business world disembedded from broader societal norms. This emancipated business world promotes a literal interpretation of Homo economicus among business organizations and their members.\r\nConsequently, we argue that the first step toward 'healthier' apples and barrels is to sanitize the larder, that is, adapt the framework in which organizations and their members evolve.","SDG":16}

Evolutionary models and empirical evidence indicate that such altruistic punishment has been a decisive force in the evolution of human cooperation. We used H2 15O positron emission tomography to examine the neural basis for altruistic punishment of defectors in an economic exchange. Subjects could punish defection either symbolically or effectively. Symbolic punishment did not reduce the defector's economic payoff, whereas effective punishment did reduce the payoff. We scanned the subjects' brains while they learned about the defector's abuse of trust and determined the punishment. Effective punishment, as compared with symbolic punishment, activated the dorsal striatum, which has been implicated in the processing of rewards that accrue as a result of goal-directed actions. Moreover, subjects with stronger activations in the dorsal striatum were willing to incur greater costs in order to punish. Our findings support the hypothesis that people derive satisfaction from punishing norm violations and that the activation in the dorsal striatum reflects the anticipated satisfaction from punishing defectors.","SDG":0}

Episodic Priming May Not Provide the Answer","ABSTRACT":"Powerful people (e.g., political and business leaders) should be able to control their impulses and act in line with long-term rather than short-term interests. However, theories of power suggest different answers to the question whether the basic experience of feeling powerful decreases (e.g., Keltner, Gruenfeld, & Anderson, 2003) or increases self-control performance (e.g., Magee & Smith, 2013). We conducted a pre-registered direct replication of the only experiment testing the effects of power on self-control (Joshi & Fast, 2013, Study 3). In contrast to the original results, social power, operationalized by episodic priming, did not affect temporal discounting. A possible explanation is the fact that the power priming failed to elevate participants\u2019 sense of power. Thus, the null findings challenge the power priming paradigm rather than the two theories from which opposite predictions were derived. In order to understand how power affects self-control, future research may need to rely on other manipulations.","SDG":0}

We use fMRI to study the neural circuitry behind forced norm compliance by comparing a treatment in which norm violations can be punished with a control treatment in which punishment is impossible. Individuals\u2019 increase in norm compliance when punishment is possible exhibits a strong positive correlation with activations in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

Moreover, activation in lateral orbitofrontal cortex shows a strong positive correlation with Machiavellian personality characteristics. These findings indicate a neural network involved in forced norm compliance that may constitute an important basis for human sociality. Different activations of this network reveal individual differences in the behavioral response to the punishment threat and may thus provide a deeper understanding of the neurobiological sources of pathologies such as antisocial personality disorder.","SDG":0}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:188938","TITLE":"The cognitive foundations of cooperation","ABSTRACT":"We conducted an experiment causally manipulating reliance on more intuitive vs. more deliberative behavior through time pressure and time delay. Our design uses a novel manipulation which relies on gradual economic incentives and was devised to avoid the high degree of non-compliance observed in previous experiments. The \u201csocial heuristic hypothesis,\u201d which claims that people are intuitively predisposed to cooperate, is not supported in our data. On the aggregate, subjects are not more cooperative under gradually-incentivized time pressure. We also measured individual attitudes on social values and attitudes toward interpersonal risk, and find that both correlate with the tendency to cooperate. A detailed analysis suggests that subjects with a stronger (resp. weaker) prosocial predisposition become more (resp. less) cooperative under time pressure compared to time delay, although the effect is only noticeable for extreme-enough predispositions. A possible interpretation is that relying on more intuitive behavior enhances individual heterogeneous predispositions, while relying on more deliberative behavior moderates them. This suggests that tendencies toward cooperation might not be universal, and rather be moderated by individual characteristics.","SDG":0}

It is facilitated when individuals represent not only their own actions but also those of their partner. Identifying whether action corepresentation is unique to humans or also present in other species is therefore necessary to fully understand the evolution of human cooperation. We used the auditory joint Simon task to assess whether action corepresentation occurs in common marmosets, a monkey species that engages extensively in coordinated action during cooperative infant care. We found that marmosets indeed show a joint Simon effect. Furthermore, when coordinating their behavior in the joint task, they were more likely to look at their partner than in a joint control condition. Corepresentation is thus not unique to humans but also present in the cooperatively breeding marmosets. Since marmosets are small-brained monkeys, our results suggest that routine coordination in space and time, rather than complex cognitive abilities, plays a role in the evolution of corepresentation.","SDG":0}

Management (diagnosis and treatment) of hypersensitivity disorders involves often intentional exposure to potentially allergenic substances (during skin testing), deliberate induction in the office of allergic symptoms to offending compounds (provocation tests) or intentional application of potentially dangerous substances (allergy vaccine) to sensitized patients. These situations may be associated with a significant risk of unwanted, excessive or even dangerous reactions, which in many instances cannot be completely avoided. However, adverse reactions can be minimized or even avoided if a physician is fully aware of potential risk and is prepared to appropriately handle the situation. Information on the risk of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in allergic diseases has been accumulated in the medical literature for decades; however, except for allergen specific immunotherapy, it has never been presented in a systematic fashion. Up to now no single document addressed the risk of the most commonly used medical procedures in the allergy office nor attempted to present general requirements necessary to assure the safety of these procedures. Following review of available literature a group of allergy experts within the World Allergy Organization (WAO), representing various continents and areas of allergy expertise, presents this report on risk associated with diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in allergology and proposes a consensus on safety requirements for performing procedures in allergy offices. Optimal safety measures including appropriate location, type and required time of supervision, availability of safety equipment, access to specialized emergency services, etc. for various procedures have been recommended.

METHODS  All original papers reporting epidemiological studies published in English, French, or German which reported on the risk of HA infection in workers exposed to sewage were eligible. They were identified by several methods and each original paper was assessed independently with a checklist by two people. Studies were classified according to the strength of their design. Non-eligible studies were also examined to assess the impact of publication bias. If the risk estimates diverged widely, causes for heterogeneity were assessed. A distinction was made between seroprevalence studies based on subclinical HA (defined only by the presence of anti-HA antibodies) and clinical HA.  RESULTS  17 eligible studies were identified. No indication of an increased risk of clinical HA could be found. For seroprevalence the studies with the strongest design suggested a slightly increased risk of subclinical HA with an odds ratio (OR) <2.5. Heterogeneity was considerable and precluded a meta-analysis. Considering non-eligible studies would still decrease the OR.  CONCLUSIONS  The systematic review does not confirm an increased risk of clinical HA in workers exposed to sewage.

A total of 1126 future travellers were recruited to have a blood sample drawn and to complete a brief questionnaire. Among these, 35 refused or were excluded, thus 1091 were evaluated. The overall prevalence of anti-HAV was 16.5%. This rate was 5.9% in future travellers born in or after 1961, 11.8% in those born 1951-60, 21.4% in those born 1941-50 and exceeded 49% in all decades born in or before 1940. Risk factors for significantly elevated anti-HAV rates were place of birth or a stay exceeding one year in tropical, subtropical or Southern European countries and travel for occupational reasons. Compared with findings from earlier surveys conducted mainly among blood donors in Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe, the results of the present study show lower anti-HAV prevalence rates.

Materials and Methods The study consisted of a retrospective part A for protocol development (n = 15) and a prospective part B to evaluate diagnostic accuracy (n = 38). All 53 participants underwent perfusion CT with 50 mL contrast material between August 2013 and September 2014. Group B underwent an additional standard multiphasic liver CT examination with 120 mL of contrast material (range, 70-143 mL). Image sets from triple arterial phase imaging were reconstructed from perfusion CT by fusing images from three dedicated arterial time points. Triple arterial phase CT and standard single arterial phase CT were compared by two readers, who assessed subjective image quality and HCC detection rate. A third reader served as reference reader and assessed objective image quality. The paired Student t test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic (JAFROC), and JAFROC curve were applied. Results The mean volume CT dose index was 11.6 mGy for triple arterial phase CT and 11.9 mGy for standard single arterial phase CT (P = .73). Triple arterial phase CT showed lower image noise and better contrast-to-noise ratio compared with standard single arterial phase CT (P < .001 and P = .032, respectively); however, there was no significant difference in lesion-to-liver-contrast ratio (P = .31). Subjective image quality was good for both protocols. The detection rate of the 65 HCC lesions was 82% for reader 1 and 83% for reader 2 at triple arterial phase CT and 80% for reader 1 and 77% for reader 2 at standard single arterial phase CT (P = .4). Conclusion Triple arterial phase imaging is feasible at the same radiation dose as that used for standard single arterial phase CT. Triple arterial phase imaging provides equivalent to superior image quality and equal HCC detection rate despite the use of less than half the contrast material dose used at standard single arterial phase CT. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018.","SDG":0}

Several of these CMR applications (eg, function and viability assessment) matured during the past years and are now established components of a cardiac workup. Perfusion-CMR is close to this status and is already a major contributor to cardiac examinations in a growing number of expert centers. Large multicenter perfusion-CMR trials comparing the diagnostic performance of CMR with other techniques were recently reported yielding areas under the receiver-operator-characteristics curve as a high as 0.85 for coronary artery disease detection (MR-IMPACT). Anticipating a growing role for perfusion-CMR in cardiology in the near future, this article discusses the principles of perfusion-CMR and its integration into the workup of patient with coronary artery disease (CAD). In addition to a functional study, this integration is mainly composed of a perfusion-CMR part, followed by a viability assessment by late enhancement CMR techniques. The principal characteristics of these CMR techniques are compared with those of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). After introduction into principles and techniques of perfusion-CMR, some open questions in perfusion-CMR and challenges for the future are addressed. Finally, newer CMR applications are shortly mentioned utilizing hyperpolarized carbon-13 compounds in experimental models for quantification of myocardial perfusion and for real-time assessment of metabolic pathways in postischemic myocardium.

Whereas this is certainly an important topic the discussion tends to overlook another longstanding but nevertheless highly relevant question, namely if and how the placebo effect should be employed in clinical practice. This paper describes the way the placebo effect is perceived in modern medicine and offers some historical reflections on how these perceptions have developed; discusses elements of a definition of the placebo effect; and suggests some conditions under which making use of the therapeutic potential of the placebo effect can be ethically acceptable, if not warranted.","SDG":16}

The claim is that a wage premium is contingent upon whether an ICT skill is a core component of the occupational skill set or a newly introduced (i.e., novel) skill element, thus engendering occupational inequality in wage returns. The study proposes a sophisticated conceptualization and extraction of types of ICT skills. It is the first one to measure employer demand for these skills directly, repeatedly (i.e., annually) and from a long-term perspective. Analyses are based on data from job advertisements taken from the Swiss Job Market Monitor (SJMM), a longitudinal dataset from 1950 onwards of annual representative samples of job vacancies advertised in the press and online that are matched to wage data taken from the Swiss Labor Force Survey (SLFS). Results show that novel ICT skills in occupations do reap a wage return, whereas core ICT skills in occupations do not. This corroborates the assumption that the unequal exposure of occupations to the digital transformation introduces a new dimension of occupational inequality in wage returns that is related to ICT skills.","SDG":10}

Both, quantitative job insecurity (insecurity over the continuity of a job) and qualitative job insecurity (insecurity over the continuity of valued aspects of the job) are examined. Based on Lazarus\u2019 theory of stress, we predict that employees\u2019 trust in their employer, perceived levels of employability and the combination effect impacts employees\u2019 perceived post-restructuring quantitative and qualitative job insecurity. Results taken from a sample of 377 employees working in Switzerland who survived restructuring mostly support these hypotheses. In general, employees with a high level of trust in their employer and high level of perceived employability show lower post-restructuring quantitative and qualitative job insecurity. Moreover, results suggest a potentially important role for the multiplicative effects of trust in one\u2019s employer and perceived employability regarding the perception of qualitative job insecurity. Implications for both research and practice are discussed.","SDG":0}

Using data on detailed labour market biographies from Germany, this paper shows that job mobility contributes to this urban premium in wage growth. In urban regions, wage growth is higher both within jobs and between jobs. The higher between-job wage growth is driven by a combination of higher frequency of job changes and a higher payoff of moving between jobs. This finding is consistent with better coordination in denser labour markets. Further evidence shows that the gain from higher urban wage growth is not lost upon moving across regions, suggesting that a better job match results in higher human capital accumulation.","SDG":11}

However, research examining the role of cultural dimensions has been largely unexplored. Drawing on the conservation of resources theory, we investigated whether the relationships between both quantitative job insecurity (i.e. the perceived threat of job loss) and qualitative job insecurity (i.e. the perceived threat of losing valued job features) and employee attitudes (job satisfaction and turnover intention) differ in culturally distinct regions. This was examined using representative employee samples from two regions of Switzerland which differ in societal practices uncertainty avoidance and performance orientation: the German-speaking (n = 966) and the French-speaking (n = 307) regions. Our research indicates that whereas the relationship between quantitative job insecurity and turnover intention is stronger in the French-speaking region where there is higher societal practice uncertainty avoidance, the relationship between qualitative job insecurity and job satisfaction is stronger in the German-speaking region where there is higher societal practice performance orientation.","SDG":0}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:191915","TITLE":"Core stability and core selection in a decentralized labor matching market","ABSTRACT":"We propose a dynamic model of decentralized many-to-one matching in the context of a competitive labor market. Through wage offers and wage demands, firms compete over workers and workers compete over jobs. Firms make hire-and-fire decisions dependent on the wages of their own workers and on the alternative workers available on the job market. Workers bargain for better jobs; either individually or collectively as unions, adjusting wage demands upward\/downward depending on whether they are currently employed\/unemployed. We show that such a process is absorbed into the core with probability one in finite time. Moreover, within the core, allocations are selected that are characterized by surplus splitting according to a bargaining solution such that (i) firms and workforce share total revenue according to relative bargaining strengths, and (ii) workers receive equal workforce shares above their individual outside options. These results bridge empirical evidence and provide a rich set of testable predictions.","SDG":0}

We used a vast array of primary and secondary sources to assemble two new databases on wages and commodity prices to establish a new regional consumer price index (CPI) and twelve regional wage series. We posit that the sluggish demographic growth during the 18th century, and the resulting labour shortage, led to a convergence of wages across unskilled occupations and a relative catch-up with urban skilled construction labourers in the years preceding the French Revolution. We also provide tentative evidence suggesting that labourers in stable employment could have earned as much as their English counterparts during this period.","SDG":10}

Applying machine learning techniques, we identify characteristics of those who used to be employed in such occupations and show they are now less likely to work in routine occupations. Instead, they are either non-participants in the labor force or working at occupations that tend to occupy the bottom of the wage distribution. We then develop a quantitative, heterogeneous agent, general equilibrium model of labor force participation, occupational choice, and capital investment. This allows us to quantify the role of advancement in automation technology in accounting for these labor market changes. We then use this framework as a laboratory to evaluate various public policies aimed at addressing the disappearance of routine employment and its consequent impacts on inequality.","SDG":16}

We use a vast array of primary and secondary sources to assemble two new databases on wages and commodity prices to establish a new regional consumer price index (CPI) and twelve regional wage series. We find that unskilled labourers earned similar wages across the agricultural, maritime, and textile sectors. Historical evidence suggests that Norman employers grappled with a tight labour market, which placed more pressure on wage increases. We posit that this situation is best explained by the combination of the early fertility transition, resulting in slow demographic growth and the rapid development of the textile industry accelerated by the arrival of cotton. Finally, we also provide tentative evidence suggesting that labourers with stable employment could have earned a little less than their English counterparts during this period.","SDG":8}

Moreover, the empirical analysis contrasts workers from small firms and large firms. The idea is that displacement carries no information about workers' productivity in large firms but is a signal of low productivity in small firms. This signal is stronger when the plant closure occurs in a boom period than in a recession period. Results indicate that the (i) state of the business cycle is important for influence the effect of displacement on labor market success and (ii) the effect differs by the size of the firm. In large firms, displaced workers suffer from larger earning losses when displacement occurs in recession compared to boom, thenopposite result is found for workers displaced from small firms.","SDG":0}

This policy brief examines variations in the time that unemployed people in Switzerland spend looking for work, comparing residents of Swiss nationality who speak German with residents who speak French or Italian. According to survey evidence and voting results, the Swiss language border separates two social groups with different cultural backgrounds and attitudes towards work. Despite similar local labor markets, French and Italian speakers who lose their job spend almost seven weeks longer in unemployment than their German-speaking neighbors. This effect is comparable to a large increase in the generosity of unemployment insurance.","SDG":8}

Despite this indisputable fact, it is a priori unclear how job search costs affect search duration and unemployment: lower search costs make it easier to find a job, reducing search duration and unemployment, but may also increase the reservation wage, increasing search duration and unemployment. I collaborate with a recruiting company to directly test the effects of lower search costs in a field experiment among approximately 400 IT professionals in Switzerland. I find that workers are more likely to search for detailed job information, but not to file a job application, when search costs are lower. These findings are consistent with an increase in the reservation wage. Lower search costs might lead to picky workers, but fail to ultimately reduce search duration and unemployment.","SDG":8}

We find a robust negative effect of unfavorable entry conditions on starting wages. This initial effect turns out to be quite persistent and even though wages do catch up later on, large effects on lifetime earnings result. We also show that initial labor market conditions have smaller and less persistent effects for blue-collar workers than for white-collar workers. We further show that some of the long-run adjustment takes place through changes in job-mobility and employment patterns as well as in job tenure. Finally, we find that adjustments at the aggregate level are key to explain wages' adjustment process in the longer run.","SDG":8}
