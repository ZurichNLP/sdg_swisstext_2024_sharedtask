{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:108257","TITLE":"On a long neglected player: The religious dimension in poverty alleviation. The example of the so-called ‘Prosperity Gospel’ in Africa","ABSTRACT":"Much of poverty alleviation theory and practice fails to sufficiently consider the following crucial factor: the religious dimension. This paper elaborates this thesis by focusing on the African context and the valuable resources African religious communities and movements can provide in the struggle against poverty. One particularly influential streak of present-time African religiousness serves as a case study: the so-called ‘Prosperity Gospel’ as part of Pentecostal Christianity. The author first argues for the continuing formative influence of religion on African conceptions of self, other, and world. Secondly, she provides a critical assessment of the impact of Pentecostalism and the ‘Prosperity Gospel’ on poverty alleviation. In comparison with secular ngos, Pentecostal churches emerge as the more effective agents of change. A third part situates the insights gained into a wider perspective, seeking ways to integrate the religious factor into a more holistic conception of and engagement against poverty.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/108257","SDG":1}

Presenting material from various Asian and Latin American countries, Frontier Encounters examines factors that make for conflict and accommodation, studies the role of policy frames, and looks at promising mitigation strategies. The range of topics covered by the articles includes the texture of everyday-relations at the settlement frontier and the reconfiguration of ethnic hierarchies in tune with changing conquest cycles; settler land and resource use strategies; anti-settler riots and their politics; peace accords and what they can and cannot achieve as instruments for halting migration-induced violence; communal land titles as a promising avenue for conflict prevention and the empowerment of weak and defenseless groups; and the need for balancing indigenous rights advocacy with support and legal protection for disenfranchised parts of the settler population.\r\nDanilo Geiger has an M. A. in social anthropology from the University of Zürich, Switzerland and is a lecturer in political anthropology.

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:219394","TITLE":"The pursuit of simplicity: Can simplifying eligibility criteria improve social pension targeting?","ABSTRACT":"Governments in developing countries struggle to reach intended beneficiaries when targeting social transfers towards vulnerable populations. Rates of eligible individuals not receiving social transfers and ineligible individuals receiving them tend to be high, constraining the effectiveness of such anti-poverty programs. While interventions to incentivize or monitor local agents in charge of selecting beneficiaries are typically expensive, an important complementary and cost-effective approach could be to reform eligibility criteria to facilitate the selection of beneficiaries. Whether reforms should focus on reducing the number of rules, or selecting criteria which are easy to verify, or do both remains an unanswered question. We address this knowledge gap based on India’s social pension scheme for elderly poor. We find that making eligibility criteria easier to verify has the potential to achieve a substantial improvement in the targeting performance through a reduction in the exclusion error. Those who meet the relevant criteria have a much higher chance of actually becoming beneficiaries. Since eligibility criteria can be changed at low cost, this suggests a viable route for reform in many developing countries. However, a major caveat remains that criteria must sufficiently well reflect actual poverty if the more accurate selection of beneficiaries according to formal criteria shall also translate into actual poverty reduction.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/219394","SDG":1}

In this article, we propose thinking beyond the practical problems caused by co-infections in order to explore medicine’s epistemological attachment to the idea of single diseases, using TB/HIV as an analytical lever. We retrace how TB/HIV co-infection has been problematised in public health discourses since the 1990s, particularly in WHO reports and international public health journals, and show that it has been mainly discussed as a complex biosocial phenomenon in need of more resources. The epistemological interrogation of the concept of co-infection itself – as an entangled object of two or more diseases with different histories and social, political, and scientific identities – is largely missing. To elaborate on this gap, we look at the translational processes between the two diseases and their communities, and suggest concrete historical and ethnographic entry points for future research on this global health phenomenon.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/116371","SDG":3}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:77777","TITLE":"Computer-based multisensory learning in children with developmental dyslexia","ABSTRACT":"PURPOSE: Several attempts have been made to remediate developmental dyslexia using various training environments. Based on the well-known retrieval structure model, the memory strength of phonemes and graphemes should be strengthened by visual and auditory associations between graphemes and phonemes. Using specifically designed training software, we examined whether establishing a multitude of visuo-auditory associations might help to mitigate writing errors in children with developmental dyslexia.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Forty-three children with developmental dyslexia and 37 carefully matched normal reading children performed a computer-based writing training (15-20 minutes 4 days a week) for three months with the aim to recode a sequential textual input string into a multi-sensory representation comprising visual and auditory codes (including musical tones). The study included four matched groups: a group of children with developmental dyslexia (n=20) and a control group (n=18) practiced with the training software in the first period (3 months, 15-20 minutes 4 days a week), while a second group of children with developmental dyslexia (n=23) (waiting group) and a second control group (n=19) received no training during the first period. In the second period the children with developmental dyslexia and controls who did not receive training during the first period now took part in the training.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Children with developmental dyslexia who did not perform computer-based training during the first period hardly improved their writing skills (post-pre improvement of 0-9%), the dyslexic children receiving training strongly improved their writing skills (post-pre improvement of 19-35%). The group who did the training during the second period also revealed improvement of writing skills (post-pre improvement of 27-35%). Interestingly, we noticed a strong transfer from trained to non-trained words in that the children who underwent the training were also better able to write words correctly that were not part of the training software. In addition, even non-impaired readers and writers (controls) benefited from this training.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Three-month of visual-auditory multimedia training strongly improved writing skills in children with developmental dyslexia and non-dyslexic children. Thus, according to the retrieval structure model, multi-sensory training using visual and auditory cues enhances writing performance in children with developmental dyslexia and non-dyslexic children.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/77777","SDG":4}

These codes represent information about letters and syllables of a word. An enhanced version, developed for this study, contains an additional phonological code and an improved word selection controller relying on a phoneme-based student model. We investigated the spelling behavior of children by means of learning curves based on log-file data of the previous and the enhanced software version. First, we compared the learning progress of children with dyslexia working either with the previous software (n = 28) or the adapted version (n = 37). Second, we investigated the spelling behavior of children with dyslexia (n = 37) and matched children without dyslexia (n = 25). To gain deeper insight into which factors are relevant for acquiring spelling skills, we analyzed the influence of cognitive abilities, such as attention functions and verbal memory skills, on the learning behavior. All investigations of the learning process are based on learning curve analyses of the collected log-file data. The results evidenced that those children with dyslexia benefit significantly from the additional phonological cue and the corresponding phoneme-based student model. Actually, children with dyslexia improve their spelling skills to the same extent as children without dyslexia and were able to memorize phoneme to grapheme correspondence when given the correct support and adequate training. In addition, children with low attention functions benefit from the structured learning environment. Generally, our data showed that memory sources are supportive cognitive functions for acquiring spelling skills and for using the information cues of a multi-modal learning environment.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/50775","SDG":4}

I argue that, even if the ERC’s gender approach has been introduced as part of international models of transitional justice, it is geared toward earlier women’s rights and human rights activism, as well as to established state practices of at least selectively supporting women’s rights. Like political reform in general, the ERC and its gender approach are an outcome of internal, long-time dynamics of change. Within the ERC’s politics of gender, there exists a tendency to depoliticize women’s rights activism in the process of reconciliation by making women a target for welfare measures and “human development.” Yet, at the same time, the officially recognized gender approach also allows for strategies to broaden the basis for women’s rights activism by making women’s experiences of violence during the “Years of Lead” (the period of fierce repression under the rule of Hassan II), an issue of concern in the framework of its new politics of memory. The implementation of the ERC’s gender approach can be interpreted as an example of how women’s rights activism may be able to push its agenda while adjusting to both transnational discourses and national politics.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/75227","SDG":5}

Drawing on a comparison of job announcements and employees’ profiles, I argue that social norms generate gendered inequalities of access to jobs as social organisers by regulating access to information, ability to travel, and eligibility for employment. In this article, I contribute to a better understanding of the gendered nature of this specific labour market, the impediments to gender equality in employment, and the need for an improvement in the work contexts of the female labour force in rural Pakistan in order to make it possible for women to do the job.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/61657","SDG":5}

The focus of the analysis is on discursive spaces that have been created for women engaged in non-domestic work. Starting from an interpretation of the existing academic literature, this paper argues that Pakistani women's non-domestic work has been conceptualised in three major ways: as a contribution to national development, as a danger to the nation, and as non-existent. The paper concludes that although some conceptualisations of work have been more powerful than others and, at specific historical junctures, have become part of concrete state policies, alternative conceptualisations have always existed alongside them. Disclosing the state's implication in the discursive construction of working women's identities might contribute to the destabilisation of hegemonic concepts of gendered divisions of labour in Pakistan.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/78605","SDG":5}

Biotransformation, i.e., transformation by microbes, is well understood for a number of priority pollutants, but a similar level of understanding is lacking for many emerging contaminants encountered at low concentrations and in complex mixtures across natural and engineered systems. Any advanced approaches aiming to reduce environmental exposure to such contaminants (e.g., novel engineered biological water treatment systems, design of readily degradable chemicals, or improved regulatory assessment strategies to determine contaminant persistence a priori) will depend on understanding the causal links among contaminant removal, the key driving agents of biotransformation at low concentrations (i.e., relevant microbes and their metabolic activities), and how their presence and activity depend on environmental conditions. In this Perspective, we present the current understanding and recent methodological advances that can help to identify such links, even in complex environmental microbiomes and for contaminants present at low concentrations in complex chemical mixtures. We discuss the ensuing insights into contaminant biotransformation across varying environments and conditions and ask how much closer we have come to designing improved approaches to reducing environmental exposure to contaminants.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/225858","SDG":6}

Automation by conventional image analysis is difficult because filaments may exhibit large variation in length and patchy autofluorescence. Moreover, individual filaments frequently cross each other on microscopic preparations, as can be deduced by modelling. This study presents a novel approach based on object oriented image analysis to simultaneously retrieve (a) filament number, (b) individual filament lengths, and (c) cumulative filament length of unbranched cyanobacterial morphotypes on fluorescence microscopic images in a fully automated high-throughput manner. Special emphasis was put on the correct detection of overlapping objects by image analysis and on the appropriate coverage of filament length distribution by using large composite images. The method was validated on a dataset of Planktothrix rubescens from field samples and compared with manual filament tracing, the line intercept method, and the Utermöhl counting approach. The described computer program features batch processing of large images from any appropriate source and annotation of detected filaments. It requires no user interaction, is freely available and might thus be a useful tool for basic research and drinking water quality control.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/26879","SDG":6}

This is mainly due to the lack of or the cumbersome requirements of the few existing baseline and monitoring methodologies as well as the difficulty to prove project additionality. We assess methodologies for projects distributing compact fluorescent lamps to households. The approval of the first large-scale methodology took more than 2 years and in the interaction with the regulatory bodies, the methodology became very cumbersome, especially regarding monitoring requirements. Four sample groups are required and the technology that has to be used for measuring utilization of CFLs does not yet exist. Therefore, project developers are not applying the large-scale methodology but try to use the pre-defined small-scale methodology. But even the small-scale methodology requires a substantial amount of data and measurements. A “Programme of Activity” approach could reduce monitoring costs through limiting monitoring to a sample of projects. Moreover, monitoring experts could be trained and thus monitoring mistakes reduced compared to single project settings. A deemed savings methodology was recently approved which alleviates but does not completely eliminate monitoring needs. It considerably reduces CER volumes compared to the other two methodologies and thus project developers have to assess the trade-off between higher monitoring costs and lower CER volumes.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/26564","SDG":7}

The interaction between multiple such green capabilities when deployed simultaneously, as well as potential interactions with other existing functionality such as quality of service functions, need to be managed transparently by the operators. We developed SLIM, the SustainabiLity Information Model for Energy Efficiency Policies, as an addon to the IETF Policy Core Information Model Extension to allow unifying the management of green capabilities throughout the network. We illustrate the flexibility of our approach by presenting a use case and describing an energy management system where SLIM was used.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/136291","SDG":7}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:177232","TITLE":"Labour market transitions after layoffs: the role of occupational skills","ABSTRACT":"We study the role of occupational skills for labour market transitions after layoffs. Drawing on Lazear’s skill-weights approach, we develop empirical measures for occupational specificity and the skill distance between occupations to investigate how skills map into job mobility and wages. Our analysis reveals several important insights. First, higher occupational specificity is associated with lower job mobility and a longer period of unemployment. However, it is also associated with higher wages. Workers receive a wage premium of about 9% for re-employment in a one standard deviation more specific occupation. These results suggest a risk–return trade-off to educational investments into more specific skills. Second, the skill distance is negatively associated with wages. Workers moving between occupations with similar skill requirements suffer smaller wage losses than those with more distant moves. Thus, skills appear to be transferable across occupations and to play a pivotal role in the determination of wages.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/177232","SDG":4}

Studies have considered both responsive and proactive customer orientation. Competitor orientation, however, has been investigated more narrowly. Research has focused specifically on its responsive dimension, a firm's posture of quickly responding to its competitors' actions and their offerings; but has largely disregarded proactive competitor orientation, a firm's posture towards altering the market's competitive behavior in its favor. This study investigates the role of responsive and proactive competitor orientation on influencing innovation and firm performance, as well as the mediating effects of technology and learning orientation. Utilizing a unique dataset that combines primary and time-lagged secondary data from 306 firms, we find that both responsive and proactive competitor orientation are observable drivers of performance in the market, but in notably different ways. Proactive competitor orientation drives innovation performance, directly and through technology orientation. Responsive competitor orientation, instead, enhances firm performance through learning orientation. By providing insights about the proactive side of competitor orientation, this study supplements and completes the so called “market orientation matrix”. This framework provides guidance for leaders to develop and manage a practical application of, and future research on market orientation.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/221832","SDG":8}

Drawing on the needs-based model and the common-ingroup identity model, we hypothesized that the experience of accepting intergroup contact and the endorsement of a dual identity representation of intergroup relations would be associated with greater support for equality. Furthermore, integrating the logic of both models, we tested the novel hypothesis that the positive effect of accepting contact on support for equality would be stronger under a high (vs. low) dual identity representation. While the predicted main effects received empirical support, we found no evidence for the expected interaction. These findings suggest that interventions to foster support for social change among advantaged group members can promote accepting contact and a dual identity representation independently of each other.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/222117","SDG":10}

Here, we combine the hawk–dove and prisoner’s dilemma games to model the effects of economic defensibility, costs of competition and gains from cooperation on egalitarianism, operationalized as the absence of hawks. We show that a ‘leveller’ strategy, which punishes hawkishness in the hawk–dove game with defection in the prisoner’s dilemma, can be evolutionarily stable provided that the gains from cooperation are high relative to the benefits of hawkishness. Under these conditions, rare mutant levellers select for hawks that acquiesce to punishment by playing dove. If these ‘acquiescent hawks’ become common, levellers outperform hawks and establish a new egalitarian equilibrium. An analysis of human foraging groups corroborates these results, as groups with a greater reliance on cooperation are more egalitarian. Cooperation fosters greater equality when individuals can withhold its benefits from would-be dominant individuals.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/200966","SDG":10}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:86511","TITLE":"Structural change and the politics of dualization","ABSTRACT":"Poverty, increased inequality, and social exclusion are back on the political agenda in Western Europe, not only as a consequence of the Great Recession of 2008, but also because of a seemingly structural trend towards increased inequality in advanced industrial societies that has persisted since the 1970s. How can we explain this increase in inequalities? Policies in labor markets, social policy, and political representation are strongly linked in the creation, widening, and deepening of insider-outsider divides—a process known as dualization. While it is certainly not the only driver of increasing inequality, the encompassing nature of its development across multiple domains makes dualization one of the most important current trends affecting developed societies. However, the extent and forms of dualization vary greatly across countries. The comparative perspective of this book provides insights into why Nordic countries witness lower levels of insider-outsider divides, whereas in continental, liberal and southern welfare states, they are more likely to constitute a core characteristic of the political economy. Most importantly, the comparisons presented in this book point to the crucial importance of politics and political choice in driving and shaping the social outcomes of deindustrialization. While increased structural labor market divides can be found across all countries, governments have a strong responsibility in shaping the distributive consequences of these labor market changes. Insider-outsider divides are not a straightforward consequence of deindustrialization, but rather the result of political choice.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/86511","SDG":10}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:94791","TITLE":"Increasing Intergroup Cooperation Toward Social Change by Restoring Advantaged and Disadvantaged Groups’ Positive Identities","ABSTRACT":"In this article, we develop a perspective on social change as cooperation between advantaged and disadvantaged groups to facilitate not only redistribution of power and wealth but also restoration of threatened identity dimensions. We argue that disadvantaged groups experience threats to their agency whereas advantaged groups experience threats to their morality. Restoration of these aspects of groups’ identities can unlock the potential for collective action among members of disadvantaged groups and for a greater willingness to change the status quo toward equality among members of advantaged groups. A major theoretical implication of these findings is that social psychological theorizing should pay greater attention to morally based motivations as critical factors in the facilitation of change. A prime practical implication is that interventions designed to improve intergroup relations should consider not only acceptance-related but also agency-related motivations (e.g., through a “common stigmatizers identity” re-categorization strategy).","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/94791","SDG":10}

Even though urban areas and respective agglomerations have continuously gained in importance in Switzerland to this day, the Swiss national population census will no longer include commuter data at high spatial resolution. Hence, the definition of the rapidly evolving urban agglomeration concept will have to be modified for future urban research and planning purposes.\r\nWe propose a crowdsourcing approach to overcome this data gap, and employ the open and web-based Wikipedia encyclopedia as a new resource to delineate agglomeration areas. Using the North Eastern parts of Switzerland in this case study, we systematically evaluate whether user-generated content can serve as an option to fill the commuter data gap in future Swiss national population censuses to define agglomeration areas. In a second step, we evaluate the influence of potential edge effects on our chosen approach.\r\nWe employ the number of hyperlinks in the Wikipedia database to quantify the strength of functional relationships between municipalities appearing in the Wikipedia encyclopedia. Next, we visualize the extracted municipality network structure for the chosen study area. Finally, we cluster the connected municipalities to agglomeration zones, and compare the computed municipality clusters with the agglomeration areas currently defined by the Swiss census.\r\nOur results suggest that the aggregation structure of our crowdsourcing approach is congruent with the officially developed agglomeration areas proposed by the Swiss census. Crowdsourced data thus might be an additional future data resource to complement more traditional census statistics for space districting purposes or socio-economic research in urban geography and planning.\r\nHowever, our results also suggest that geographic space indeed influences even non-spatially organized, crowdsourced encyclopedic entries, and this must be systematically studied further in future studies.\r\nEnglish Title: Agglomerations newly defined with crowdsourced data: visualizing North Eastern Switzerland based on Wikipedia content.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/94156","SDG":11}

Traffic events are related to traffic accidents, congestion, parking issues, to name a few. Currently, traffic events are detected through static sensors e.g., CCTV camera, loop detectors. However they have limited spatial coverage and high maintenance cost, especially in developing regions. On the other hand, with Web 2.0 and ubiquitous mobile platforms, people can act as social sensors sharing different traffic events along with their locations. We investigated whether Twitter - a social media platform can be useful to understand urban traffic events from tweets in India. However, such tweets are informal and noisy and containing vernacular geographical information making the location retrieval task challenging. So far most authors have used geotagged tweets to identify traffic events which accounted for only 0.1%-3% or sometimes less than that. Recently Twitter has removed precise geotagging, further decreasing the utility of such approaches. To address these issues, this research explored how ungeotagged tweets could be used to understand traffic events in India. We developed a novel framework that does not only categorize traffic related tweets but also extracts the locations of the traffic events from the tweet content in Greater Mumbai. The results show that an SVM based model performs best detecting traffic related tweets. While extracting location information, a hybrid georeferencing model consists of a supervised learning algorithm and a number of spatial rules outperforms other models. The results suggest people in India, especially in Greater Mumbai often share traffic information along with location mentions, which can be used to complement existing physical transport infrastructure in a cost-effective manner to manage transport services in the urban environment.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/179196","SDG":11}

To reduce the manual labelling effort by human experts and to scale to large, meaningful regions, we investigate in this study how domain adaptation techniques and deep learning can help to efficiently map land cover in Central Africa. We propose and evaluate a methodology that is based on unsupervised adaptation to reduce the cost of generating reference data for several cities and across different dates. We present the first application of domain adaptation based on fully convolutional networks for semantic segmentation of a dataset of historical panchromatic orthomosaics for land-cover generation for two focus cities Goma-Gisenyi and Bukavu. Our experimental evaluation shows that the domain adaptation methods can reach an overall accuracy between 60% and 70% for different regions.

However, their measurement according to regulatory testing guidelines is laborious and costly. Despite the obvious ecological and economic benefits of knowing environmental degradability as early as possible, its consideration in the early phases of rational chemical design is therefore challenging. Here, we explore the possibility to use half-lives determined in highly time- and work-efficient biotransformation experiments with activated sludge and mixtures of chemicals to predict soil half-lives from regulatory simulation studies. We experimentally determined half-lives for 52 structurally diverse agrochemical active ingredients in batch reactors with three concentrations of the same activated sludge. We then developed bi- and multivariate models for predicting half-lives in soil by regressing the experimentally determined half-lives in activated sludge against average soil half-lives of the same chemicals extracted from regulatory data. The models differed in how we accounted for sorption-related bioavailability differences in soil and activated sludge. The best-performing models exhibited good coefficients of determination (R2 of around 0.8) and low average errors (<factor of 3 in half-life predictions) and were robust in cross-validation. From a practical perspective, these results suggest that it may indeed be possible to read across from half-lives determined in highly efficient biotransformation experiments in activated sludge to soil half-lives, which are obtained from much more work- and resource-intense regulatory studies, and that these predictions are clearly superior to predictions based on the output of BIOWIN, a publicly available quantitative structure-biodegradation relationship (QSBR) model. From a theoretical perspective, these results suggest that soil and activated sludge microbial communities, although certainly different in terms of taxonomic composition, may be functionally similar with respect to the enzymatic transformation of environmentally relevant concentrations of a diverse range of chemical compounds.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/199053","SDG":12}

Taking advantage of the most up-to-date life cycle inventory database available (ecoinvent data version 2.01), all life cycle phases were assessed and the sensitivity of the results for varying assumptions analysed: different qualities of compact fluorescent lamps (production phase), different electricity mixes (use phase), and endof- life scenarios for WEEE recycling versus municipal solid waste incineration (disposal phase).

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:197669","TITLE":"Environmental lmplications of Service Life Extension of Mobile Devices","ABSTRACT":"The number of mobile Intemet-enabled devices (MIEDs) is growing. Producing MIEDs requires resources, energy and causes considerable emissions. Extending the service life MIEDs could significantly reduce the demand for new devices and associated environmental impacts. However, whether service life extension actually reduces environmental impacts associated with MIEDs is still uncertain. First, available life cycle assessments of MIEDs suggest that the production of integrated circuits (ICs) accounts for the majority of GHG emissions during the production phase and that greenhouse gas emissions increase with the size of the device and, more importantly, with its storage capacity. However, there is only little information available on MIED specific components such as logic or memory type integrated circuits. In order to quantify environmental impacts of service life extension of MIEDs new approaches for life cycle inventory modelling (e.g. modular modelling) are required. Second, service life-extending measures are subject to rebound effects, which occur if the number of devices being produced does not fall as expected. Such effects depend on consumer behaviour (e.g. re-spending effects) and the rationalities of involved economic actors. Thus, environmental, behavioural and economic aspects have tobe taken into account in order to develop service life-extending measures that entail environmental benefits while being both economically viable and appealing to consumers.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/197669","SDG":12}

The Rwandan approach to international climate finance aims at maximizing effectiveness and alignment across Rwandan government institutions. Its cornerstone is the Rwanda Green Fund (FONERWA) which invests in the best public and private projects that have the potential for transformative change and that align with Rwanda's commitment to building a strong green economy. FONERWA also provides expert technical assistance to ensure the success of its investments. The chapter describes international climate finance received by Rwanda to date and discusses the strategy to mobilize climate finance, the national priorities and challenges encountered over time. While Rwanda has been able to mobilize some international climate finance through a coordinated approach, a significant upscaling is required to reach the ambitious conditional targets of the updated NDC.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/229761","SDG":8}

There are more than 2000 sites along the coast of Brazil that range in age from 8,720 to 985 cal BP. Here, we studied the ichthyoarchaeological remains (i.e., cranial/postcranial bones, otoliths, and teeth, among others) at 13 shellmounds on the southern coast of the state of Rio de Janeiro, which are located in coastal landscapes, including a sandy plain with coastal lagoons, rocky islands, islets and rocky bays. We identified patterns of similarity between shellmounds based on fish diversity, the ages of the assemblages, littoral geomorphology and prehistoric fisheries. Our new radiocarbon dating, based on otolith samples, was used for fishery characterization over time. A taxonomical study of the ichthyoarchaeological remains includes a diversity of 97 marine species, representing 37% of all modern species (i.e., 265 spp.) that have been documented along the coast of Rio de Janeiro state. This high fish diversity recovered from the shellmounds is clear evidence of well-developed prehistoric fishery activity that targeted sharks, rays and finfishes in a productive area influenced by coastal marine upwelling. The presence of adult and neonate shark, especially oceanic species, is here interpreted as evidence of prehistoric fisheries capacity for exploitation and possibly overexploitation in nursery areas. Various tools and strategies were used to capture finfish in seasonal fisheries, over rocky reef bottoms and in sandy littoral environments. Massive catches of whitemouth croaker, main target dermersal species of South Atlantic coast, show evidence of a reduction in body size of approximately 28% compared with modern fisheries. Fishery activity involving vulnerable species, especially in nursery areas, could mark the beginning of fish depletion along the southeastern Brazilian coast and the collapse of natural fish populations.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/124811","SDG":14}

Informed selection and prioritisation of areas for the conservation of inshore delphinids requires a comprehensive understanding of their distribution and habitat use. In this study, we applied an ensemble species distribution modelling approach, combining results of six modelling algorithms to identify areas of high probability of occurrence of the globally Vulnerable Australian humpback dolphin in northern Ningaloo Marine Park (NMP), north-western Australia. Model outputs were based on sighting data collected during systematic, boat-based surveys between 2013 and 2015, and in relation to various ecogeographic variables. Water depth and distance to coast were identified as the most important variables influencing dolphin presence, with dolphins showing a preference for shallow waters (5–15 m) less than 2 km from the coast. Areas of high probability (> 0.6) of dolphin occurrence were primarily (90%) in multiple use areas where extractive human activities are permitted, and were poorly represented in sanctuary (no-take) zones. This spatial mismatch emphasises the need to reassess for future spatial planning and marine park management plan reviews for NMP. Shallow, coastal waters identified here should be considered priority areas for the conservation of this Vulnerable species.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/191803","SDG":14}

Considerable economic development is expected in particularly for tourism, navigation and aquaculture. However, in recent years the environmental quality of the Bay has been degraded by human activities and impacts. Even though the conditions of the Bay are monitored with in-situ measurements in a marine station, the environmental data, measured only in half-yearly intervals, are not sufficient for comprehensively assessing environmental quality at various temporal and spatial scales.\r\nTherefore, it is necessary to seek for complementary data sources to assess, control and manage the marine\r\nenvironment of Nha Trang Bay. We conducted three field trips in Nha Trang Bay at 23 stations, including 6 off-shore stations that are not influenced by freshwater from land, and measured the distribution of marine optical properties. These properties include the light extinction coefficient (K) of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the surface layer (i.e. 1m depth) and in water columns. K ranged from 0.099 m-1 off-shore to 0.409 m-1 in coastal waters. In addition, light absorption at various wavelengths were used to assess the concentration of chlorophyll-a, total suspended sediments and primary production. Further, we collected and used spatially explicit data using the OC4 method and the method of band 1, 2 and 3 ratios of the Landsat TM satellite. A data comparison confirms a significant correlation between the different sources of in-situ and remotely sensed data of light absorption. However, the predicted values at stations with a water depth of less than 5 m are significantly affected by sea bottom reflection of, for example, mud, sand, coral reefs and algae.\r\nThe results indicate that it is appropriate to use remote sensing methods to derive spatially explicit distributed variables of optical properties and derived products for an environmental assessment of coastal waters.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/20359","SDG":14}

A key factor distinguishing among agroforests is land-use history - whether agroforests are established inside forests or on historically forested but currently open lands. The disparity between land-use histories means the appropriate biodiversity baselines may differ, which should be accounted for when assessing the conservation value of agroforests. Specifically, comparisons between multiple baselines in forest and open land could enrich understanding of species' responses by contextualizing them. We made such comparisons based on data from a recently published meta-analysis of the effects of cocoa (Theobroma cacao) agroforestry on bird diversity. We regrouped rustic, mixed shade cocoa, and low shade cocoa agroforests, based on land-use history, into forest-derived and open-land-derived agroforests and compared bird species diversity (species richness, abundance, and Shannon's index values) between forest and open land, which represented the 2 alternative baselines. Bird diversity was similar in forest-derived agroforests and forests (Hedges' g* estimate [SE] = -0.3144 [0.3416], p = 0.36). Open-land-derived agroforests were significantly less diverse than forests (g* = 1.4312 [0.6308], p = 0.023) and comparable to open lands (g* = -0.1529 [0.5035], p = 0.76). Our results highlight how land-use history determined the conservation value of cocoa agroforests. Forest-derived cocoa agroforests were comparable to the available - usually already degraded - forest baselines, but entail future degradation risks. In contrast, open-land-derived cocoa agroforestry may offer restoration opportunities. Our results showed that comparisons among multiple baselines may inform relative contributions of agroforestry systems to bird conservation on a landscape scale.\r\n\r\nKeywords: agrobosque derivado de bosque; agrobosque derivado de campo abierto; agroecology; agroecología; cacao; conservación; conservation; degradación forestal; forest degradation; forest-derived agroforest; meta-analysis; open-land-derived agroforest; ornithology; ornitología; review; 保护; 可可; 来自开阔地的农林、鸟类学; 来自森林的农林; 森林退化; 综述; 荟萃分析.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/218997","SDG":15}

Given that not all species are equally threatened and that resources are always limited, establishing robust prioritisation schemes is critical for implementing effective conservation actions. To this end, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species has become a widely used source of information on species’ extinction risk. Various metrics have been proposed that combine IUCN status with different aspects of biodiversity to identify conservation priorities. However, current strategies do not take full advantage of palaeontological data, with conservation palaeobiology often focussing on the near-time fossil record (the last 2 million years). Here, we make a case for the value of the deep-time (over 2 million years ago), as it can offer tangible parallels with today’s biodiversity crisis and inform on the intrinsic traits that make species prone to extinction. As such, palaeontological data holds great predictive power, which could be harnessed to flag species likely to be threatened but that are currently too poorly known to be identified as such. Finally, we identify key IUCN-based prioritisation metrics and outline opportunities for integrating palaeontological data to validate their implementation. Although the human signal of the current extinction crisis makes direct comparisons with the geological past challenging, the deep-time fossil record has more to offer to conservation than is currently recognised.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/224628","SDG":15}

Drastic loss in genetic diversity at such loci constitutes an extinction risk and should be monitored in species of conservation concern. However, effective implementations of genome-wide immune polymorphism sets into high-throughput genotyping assays are scarce. Here, we report the design and validation of a microfluidics-based amplicon sequencing assay to comprehensively capture genetic variation in Alpine ibex (Capra ibex). This species represents one of the most successful large mammal restorations recovering from a severely depressed census size and a massive loss in diversity at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). We analysed 65 whole-genome sequencing sets of the Alpine ibex and related species to select the most representative markers and to prevent primer binding failures. In total, we designed ~1,000 amplicons densely covering the MHC, further immunity-related genes as well as randomly selected genome-wide markers for the assessment of neutral population structure. Our analysis of 158 individuals shows that the genome-wide markers perform equally well at resolving population structure as RAD-sequencing or low-coverage genome sequencing data sets. Immunity-related loci show unexpectedly high degrees of genetic differentiation within the species. Such information can now be used to define highly targeted individual translocations. Our design strategy can be realistically implemented into genetic surveys of a large range of species. In conclusion, leveraging whole-genome sequencing data sets to design targeted amplicon assays allows the simultaneous monitoring of multiple genetic risk factors and can be translated into species conservation recommendations.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/206218","SDG":15}

Commercial forestry is the greatest threat to biodiversity in boreal forests. Forestry practices have degraded most available habitat, threatening the persistence of natural populations. Understanding population responses is, therefore, critical for their conservation. Population viability analyses are effective tools to predict population persistence under forestry management. However, quantifying the mechanisms driving population responses is complex as population dynamics vary temporally and spatially. Metapopulation dynamics are governed by local dynamics and spatial factors, potentially mediating the impacts of forestry e.g., through dispersal. Here, we performed a seasonal, spatially explicit population viability analysis, using long-term data from a group-living territorial bird (Siberian jay, Perisoreus infaustus). We quantified the effects of forest management on metapopulation dynamics, via forest type-specific demography and spatially explicit dispersal, and how forestry impacted the stability of metapopulation dynamics. Forestry reduced metapopulation growth and stability, through negative effects on reproduction and survival. Territories in higher quality natural forest contributed more to metapopulation dynamics than managed forests, largely through demographic processes rather than dispersal. Metapopulation dynamics in managed forest were also less resilient to disturbances and consequently, may be more vulnerable to environmental change. Seasonal differences in source-sink dynamics observed in managed forest, but not natural forests, were caused by associated seasonal differences in dispersal. As shown here, capturing seasonal source-sink dynamics allows us to predict population persistence under human disturbance and to provide targeted conservation recommendations.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/216365","SDG":15}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:107965","TITLE":"Mediatization of politics: Transforming democracies and reshaping politics","ABSTRACT":"The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview, analysis, and synthesis of theory and research on the mediatization of politics. The mediatization of politics is defined as a long-term process through which the importance of the media and their spill-over effects on political processes, institutions, organizations, and actors has increased. Four dimensions can be distinguished in this process, related to the importance of media as source of information about politics and society, the autonomy of media institutions from other social and political institutions, and the extent to which media content and political institutions, organizations, and actors respectively are guided by media logic or political logic. Both media logic and political logic are conceptualized as three-dimensional concepts. While media logic is conceptualized as shaped by professionalism, commercialism, and media technology, political logic is conceptualized as shaped by polity, policy, and politics. The chapter also analyzes the concepts of media influence and media effects within the context of the mediatization of politics. The chapter concludes by identifying five challenges for further theory and research on the mediatization of politics.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/107965","SDG":16}

Yet this debate overlooks the influence of the broader societal context on organizational behavior. In this article, we argue that misbehaviors of organizations (the 'barrels') and their members (the 'apples') cannot be addressed properly without a clear understanding of their broader context (the 'larder').\r\nWhereas previously, a strong societal framework dampened the practical application of the Homo economicus concept (business actors as perfectly rational and egocentric utility-maximizing agents without any moral concern), specialization, individualization, and globalization led to a business world disembedded from broader societal norms. This emancipated business world promotes a literal interpretation of Homo economicus among business organizations and their members.\r\nConsequently, we argue that the first step toward 'healthier' apples and barrels is to sanitize the larder, that is, adapt the framework in which organizations and their members evolve.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/58072","SDG":12}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:135973","TITLE":"Does Power Increase Self-Control? Episodic Priming May Not Provide the Answer","ABSTRACT":"Powerful people (e.g., political and business leaders) should be able to control their impulses and act in line with long-term rather than short-term interests. However, theories of power suggest different answers to the question whether the basic experience of feeling powerful decreases (e.g., Keltner, Gruenfeld, & Anderson, 2003) or increases self-control performance (e.g., Magee & Smith, 2013). We conducted a pre-registered direct replication of the only experiment testing the effects of power on self-control (Joshi & Fast, 2013, Study 3). In contrast to the original results, social power, operationalized by episodic priming, did not affect temporal discounting. A possible explanation is the fact that the power priming failed to elevate participants’ sense of power. Thus, the null findings challenge the power priming paradigm rather than the two theories from which opposite predictions were derived. In order to understand how power affects self-control, future research may need to rely on other manipulations.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/135973","SDG":16}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:77234","TITLE":"Shopping for development: Multilateral lending, shareholder composition and borrower preferences","ABSTRACT":"This paper proposes two theoretical considerations regarding Multilateral development banks (MDBs). The first is that MDB activities are increasingly driven by the growing economic strength of many developing countries. The second is that categorizing MDBs according to the balance of power among shareholders helps explain why countries might prefer one or another MDB. We compare three different MDBs operating in Latin America—one dominated by nonborrowers (World Bank), another controlled by borrowing countries (Andean Development Corporation, CAF), and a third more evenly split between borrowers and nonborrowers (Inter-American Development Bank, IADB). Qualitative and statistical analysis suggests that demand factors play an important role in MDB lending.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/77234","SDG":17}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:225308","TITLE":"Between impact and returns: Private investors and the sustainable development goals","ABSTRACT":"We investigate the expectations of wealthy private investors regarding the impact and financial return of sustainable investments. Our paper focuses on the sustainable development goals (SDGs) as a framework for investors' attempts to create impact. We analyze the behavior of 60 high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs), a powerful yet overlooked investor segment. Our results show large allocations in line with the SDGs, which demonstrates these investors' aim of achieving real-word changes. Furthermore, we show that these “impact investors” have a clear preference for SDGs that are associated with high financial returns. As such, we confirm that both impact and attractive financial returns are expected. Our findings provide rich, deep insights into how HNWIs practice impact investing and their underlying motivations. We outline practical implications for different stakeholders, notably regarding the fact that financially attractive SDGs are likely to attract substantial amounts of capital, with other SDGs remaining underfunded.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/225308","SDG":17}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:214990","TITLE":"Evolutionary dynamics of higher-order interactions in social networks","ABSTRACT":"We live and cooperate in networks. However, links in networks only allow for pairwise interactions, thus making the framework suitable for dyadic games, but not for games that are played in larger groups. Here, we study the evolutionary dynamics of a public goods game in social systems with higher-order interactions. First, we show that the game on uniform hypergraphs corresponds to the replicator dynamics in the well-mixed limit, providing a formal theoretical foundation to study cooperation in networked groups. Second, we unveil how the presence of hubs and the coexistence of interactions in groups of different sizes affects the evolution of cooperation. Finally, we apply the proposed framework to extract the actual dependence of the synergy factor on the size of a group from real-world collaboration data in science and technology. Our work provides a way to implement informed actions to boost cooperation in social groups.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/214990","SDG":16}

The trial was evaluated with the aid of an accompanying research. Among the results demonstrated in the evaluation was an improvement of the health of the participants. The economic assessment was drawn from observations of health effects within a sub-sample of 142 participants from four centers. In a retrospective statistical survey, for each acute illness which could be influenced through the trial, the number of diagnoses was recorded in the first and thirteenth month after study entry. Also, based on a number of representative cases for each of these acute illnesses, the resource use, i.e. the types and numbers of medical products and services rendered to the patients, was recorded. The results showed a clear decline in depressive episodes, skin diseases, digestive system disorders as well as epileptic attacks and intoxication. Treatment costs could be reduced from a total of CHF 94875.--to CHF 21,998.--/month or from CHF 22.27 to CHF 5.15/patient per day. The improvement of somatic and psychic health due to the medically controlled prescription of narcotics resulted in a benefit of CHF 17.11/person per day.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/90253","SDG":3}

Eighty-one measurements were carried out on urine and serum samples and the scientific results together with individual questionnaire information were entered into a central database. Data obtained was assessed centrally and individually in subsidiary studies. The measurable contributions were assessed either singly or in combination, of smoking, gender, metal exposure and site, to nephrotoxicity. The potential value of each test as an indicator of nephrotoxicity was then assessed on the basis of sensitivity and specificity. A number of new tests including prostaglandins and for extracellular matrix components were investigated as well as established tests for renal damage and dysfunction. The data obtained from this comprehensive study emphasises the value of noninvasive biomarkers for the early detection of nephrotoxicity due to environmental toxins. The urinary profile varied with the type of environmental/occupational toxin. By careful selection of a small panel of markers they can be used to indicate the presence of renal damage, the principal region affected, and to monitor the progress of disease and damage. Biomarkers were also used to confirm and tentatively establish safe exposure levels to nephrotoxins.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/124678","SDG":9}

While 6 main genotypes generally distinguish the global geographic diversity of HCV, a multitude of closely related subtypes within these genotypes are poorly defined and may influence clinical outcome and treatment options. Unfortunately, the paucity of genetic data from many of these subtypes makes time-consuming primer walking the limiting step for sequencing understudied subtypes.Methods. Here we combined long-range polymerase chain reaction amplification with pyrosequencing for a rapid approach to generate the complete viral coding region of 31 samples representing poorly defined HCV subtypes.Results. Phylogenetic classification based on full genome sequences validated previously identified HCV subtypes, identified a recombinant sequence, and identified a new distinct subtype of genotype 4. Unlike conventional sequencing methods, use of deep sequencing also facilitated characterization of minor drug resistance variants within these uncommon or, in some cases, previously uncharacterized HCV subtypes.Conclusions. These data aid in the classification of uncommon HCV subtypes while also providing a high-resolution view of viral diversity within infected patients, which may be relevant to the development of therapeutic regimens to minimize drug resistance.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/74093","SDG":3}

Applying machine learning techniques, we identify characteristics of those who used to be employed in such occupations and show they are now less likely to work in routine occupations. Instead, they are either non-participants in the labor force or working at occupations that tend to occupy the bottom of the wage distribution. We then develop a quantitative, heterogeneous agent, general equilibrium model of labor force participation, occupational choice, and capital investment. This allows us to quantify the role of advancement in automation technology in accounting for these labor market changes. We then use this framework as a laboratory to evaluate various public policies aimed at addressing the disappearance of routine employment and its consequent impacts on inequality.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/185103","SDG":8}

Our approach provides useful information on both, average effects of the program as well as information on the effects of the program for each individual. Evidence on individual treatment effects is helpful as it can be used to improve the targeting of programs.","URL":"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/52030","SDG":4}
