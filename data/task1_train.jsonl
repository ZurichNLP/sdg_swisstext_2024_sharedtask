The R group represents different tri-peptides (tpe) which display high binding affinities for oligopeptide transporters PEPT2. The $^{99m}$Tc complexes were prepared directly from [$^{99m}$Tc(OH$_2$)$_3$(CO)$_3$]+ and Diels\u2013Alder dimerized, cyclopentadienyl derivatized peptides in water. This approach corroborates the feasibility of metal-mediated retro Diels\u2013Alder reactions for the preparation of not only small molecules but also peptides carrying a [(\u03b7$^5$-Cp)$^{99m}$Tc(CO)$_3$] tag. We synthesized the Diels\u2013Alder product [(HCpCONH-tpe)$_2$] from Thiele's acid [(\u03b7$^5$-HCpCOOH)$_2$] via double peptide coupling. The Re-complexes [(\u03b7$^5$-CpCONH-tpe)Re(CO)$_3$] were obtained by attaching [(Cp-COOH)Re(CO)$_3$] directly to the N-terminus of peptides as received from SPPS. The authenticity of the $^{99m}$Tc-complexes is confirmed by chromatographic comparison with the corresponding rhenium complexes, fully characterized by spectroscopic techniques.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/106593","SDG":0}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:203310","TITLE":"Intelligence test items varying in capacity demands cannot be used to test the causality of working memory capacity for fluid intelligence","ABSTRACT":"There is a strong relationship between fluid intelligence and working memory capacity (WMC). Yet, the cognitive mechanisms underlying this relationship remain elusive. The capacity hypothesis states that this relationship is due to limitations in the amount of information that can be stored and held active in working memory. Previous research aimed at testing the capacity hypothesis assumed that it implies stronger relationships of intelligence test performance with WMC for test items with higher capacity demands. The present article addresses this assumption through simulations of three theoretical models implementing the capacity hypothesis while systematically varying different psychometric variables. The results show that almost any relation between the capacity demands of items and their correlation with WMC can be obtained. Therefore, the assumption made by previous studies does not hold: The capacity hypothesis does not imply stronger correlations of WMC and intelligence test items with higher capacity demands. Items varying in capacity demands cannot be used to test the causality of WMC (or any other latent variable) for fluid intelligence.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/203310","SDG":0}

We therefore tested whether structural variants accumulate in a fish of recent hybrid origin, invasive Cottus, relative to both parental species Cottus rhenanus and Cottus perifretum. Copy-number variation in exons of 10,979 genes was assessed using comparative genome hybridization arrays. Twelve genes showed significantly higher copy numbers in invasive Cottus compared to both parents. This coincided with increased expression for three genes related to vision, detoxification and muscle development, suggesting possible gene dosage effects. Copy number increases of putative transposons were assessed by comparative mapping of genomic DNA reads against a de novo assembly of 1,005 repetitive elements. In contrast to exons, copy number increases of repetitive elements were common (20.7%) in invasive Cottus, whereas decrease was very rare (0.01%). Among the increased repetitive elements, 53.8% occurred at higher numbers in C. perifretum compared to C. rhenanus, while only 1.4% were more abundant in C. rhenanus. This implies a biased mutational process that amplifies genetic material from one ancestor. To assess the frequency of de novo mutations through hybridization, we screened 64 laboratory-bred F2 offspring between the parental species for copy-number changes at five candidate loci. We found no evidence for new structural variants, indicating that they are too rare to be detected given our sampling scheme. Instead, they must have accumulated over more generations than we observed in a controlled cross.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/145601","SDG":14}

Some mean-field approaches (MFA) to describe these systems, based on the standard grand canonical ensemble, do not take the anomalous density into account and leads to an internal inconsistency, as it has been shown by Hohenberg and Martin, and may therefore produce unphysical results. Moreover, an explicit breaking of the U(1) symmetry as observed, for example, in TlCuCl3 makes the application of MFA more complicated. In the present work, we develop a self-consistent MFA approach, similar to the Hartree\u2013Fock\u2013Bogolyubov approximation in the notion of representative statistical ensembles, including the effect of a weakly broken U(1) symmetry. We apply our results on experimental data of the quantum magnet TlCuCl3 and show that magnetization curves and the energy dispersion can be well described within this approximation assuming that the BEC scenario is still valid. We predict that the shift of the critical temperature T c due to a finite exchange anisotropy is rather substantial even when the anisotropy parameter \u03b3 is small, e.g., ${\\rm{\\Delta }}{T}_{{c}}\\approx 10 \\% $ of T c in H = 6 T and for $\\gamma \\approx 4$ $\\mu \\mathrm{eV}$.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/147901","SDG":0}

And how may the answer to this question depend on whether the punisher is the victim of a norm violation or an independent third party? We conduct an experiment and find that third parties punish reluctantly: although they indicate a preference to punish, they choose to avoid the opportunity to punish when they can do so without explicitly revealing that this is their preference. In contrast, second parties, who have been directly wronged, are resolute punishers\u2014they actively seek out the opportunity to punish, even misrepresenting random outcomes in order to ensure that punishment is implemented.

I argue that making income and wealth separate arguments of utility has important implications that may not be widely recognized. A framework is presented that allows the unified treatment of expected utility models and anomalies. I show that expected utility of income models can predict framing induced preference reversals, a willingness to pay-willingness to accept gap for lotteries, and choice-value preference reversals. The main contribution is a theorem. It is proved that for all utility functions where initial wealth and income enter separately, either there will be preference reversals or preferences can be represented by a utility function defined on final wealth alone","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/156752","SDG":0}

Model forecasting error (FE) is the usual measure of success; however model predictions provide no insights into the potential for improvement. In short, the realized predictability of a specific model is uninformative about whether the system is inherently predictable or whether the chosen model is a poor match for the system and our observations thereof. Ideally, model proficiency would be judged with respect to the systems\u2019 intrinsic predictability \u2013 the highest achievable predictability given the degree to which system dynamics are the result of deterministic v. stochastic processes. Intrinsic predictability may be quantified with permutation entropy (PE), a model-free, information-theoretic measure of the complexity of a time series. By means of simulations we show that a correlation exists between estimated PE and FE and show how stochasticity, process error, and chaotic dynamics affect the relationship. This relationship is verified for a dataset of 461 empirical ecological time series. We show how deviations from the expected PE-FE relationship are related to covariates of data quality and the nonlinearity of ecological dynamics.\r\n\r\nThese results demonstrate a theoretically-grounded basis for a model-free evaluation of a system\u2019s intrinsic predictability. Identifying the gap between the intrinsic and realized predictability of time series will enable researchers to understand whether forecasting proficiency is limited by the quality and quantity of their data or the ability of the chosen forecasting model to explain the data. Intrinsic predictability also provides a model-free baseline of forecasting proficiency against which modeling efforts can be evaluated.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/164914","SDG":15}

Here, we examine the evidence for the hypothesis that poverty may have particular psychological consequences that can lead to economic behaviors that make it difficult to escape poverty. The evidence indicates that poverty causes stress and negative affective states which in turn may lead to short-sighted and risk-averse decision-making, possibly by limiting attention and favoring habitual behaviors at the expense of goal-directed ones. Together, these relationships may constitute a feedback loop that contributes to the perpetuation of poverty.

Corpora like Early English Books Online (EEBO), Corpus of Late Modern English Texts (CLMET) and Corpus of Historical American English (COHA) allow us to apply statistical data-driven models extracting patterns to confirm our expectations. As systems biology has revolutionised biology by systematically searching for all patterns, we detect patterns in our data systematically with contextual and distributional semantic approaches, an approach that could be called systems history. We uncover semantic patterns with methods from text mining, computational linguistics and digital humanities. We normalise the spelling automatically to present-day variants and use bottom-up analyses to step from words to concepts: collocations, topic modelling and distributional semantics. We illustrate the approaches with two case studies: associations of poverty changing across time, and Charles Dickens social criticism, his vision of helping to improve the situation of the poor. As no gold standard for our task exists, our approaches are exploratory, which entails considerable manual intervention, e.g. sifting candidate lists, reading excerpts and interpreting topic models. A fully automatic approach is currently neither feasible nor envisaged: semi-automatic approaches give researchers the inspiring opportunity to interact with the texts in a constant move between distant and close reading.

Mutations appear spontaneously in nature and are one of the underlying driving forces of evolution. In plants, in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro random mutagenesis relies on the application of physical and chemical mutagens to increase the frequency of mutations thus accelerating the selection of varieties with important agronomic traits. The European Commission has requested EFSA to provide a more detailed description of in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro random mutagenesis techniques and the types of mutations and mechanisms involved, to be able to conclude on whether in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro random mutagenesis techniques are to be considered different techniques. To address the European Commission request, a literature search was conducted to collect information on the random mutagenesis techniques used in plants both in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro, on the type of mutations generated by such techniques and on the molecular mechanisms underlying formation of those mutations. The GMO Panel\u00a0concludes that most physical and chemical mutagenesis techniques have been applied both in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro; the mutation process and the repair mechanisms act at cellular level and thus there is no difference between application of the mutagen in\u00a0vivo or in\u00a0vitro; and the type of mutations induced by a specific mutagen are expected to be the same, regardless of whether such mutagen is applied in\u00a0vivo or in\u00a0vitro. Indeed, the same mutation and the derived trait in a given plant species can be potentially obtained using both in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro random mutagenesis and the resulting mutants would be indistinguishable. Therefore, the GMO Panel\u00a0concludes that the distinction between plants obtained by in\u00a0vitro or in\u00a0vivo approaches is not justified.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/212636","SDG":0}

Surveys of institutional stakeholders identified deep tubewells and piped water systems as the most preferred options, and the same preferences were found in household surveys of populations at risk. Psychological surveys revealed that these two technologies were well-supported by potential users, with self-efficacy and social norms being the principle factors driving behavior change. The principle drawbacks of deep tubewells are that installation costs are too high for most families to own private wells, and that for various socio-cultural-religious reasons, people are not willing to walk long distances to access communal tubewells. In addition, water sector planners have reservations about greater exploitation of the deep aquifer, out of concern for current or future geogenic contamination. Groundwater models and field studies have shown that in the great majority of the affected areas, the risk of arsenic contamination of deep groundwater is small; salinity, iron, and manganese are more likely to pose problems. These constituents can in some cases be avoided by exploiting an intermediate depth aquifer of good chemical quality, which is hydraulically and geochemically separate from the arsenic-contaminated shallow aquifer. Deep tubewells represent a technically sound option throughout much of the arsenic-affected regions, and future mitigation programs should build on and accelerate construction of deep tubewells. Utilization of deep tubewells, however, could be improved by increasing the tubewell density (which requires stronger financial support) to reduce travel times, by considering water quality in a holistic way, and by accompanying tubewell installation with motivational interventions based on psychological factors. By combining findings from technical and social sciences, the efficiency and success of arsenic mitigation in general - and installation of deep tubewells in particular - can be significantly enhanced.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/89201","SDG":6}

Four ejaculates were collected from each of six bulls. Each ejaculate was diluted and divided into two aliquots; one was incubated for 24 hours at 37 \u00b0C, and the other frozen, thawed, and incubated for 24 hours at 37 \u00b0C. Analyses of quality of sperm were performed after 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours of incubation. Progressive motile sperm was determined with computer assisted sperm analysis. Percentages of plasma membrane- and acrosome-intact sperm, sperm with a high mitochondrial membrane potential, sperm showing a high degree of DNA fragmentation (%DFI), and their reactive oxygen species content were assessed with dichlorofluorescein-diacetate, dihydrorhodamine, diaminofluorescein diacetate, and mitochondrial superoxide indicator using flow cytometry. Although all other sperm parameters showed alterations (P < 0.05) during the 24-hour incubation time, %DFI stayed constant (P > 0.05, 0.91 \u00b1 0.23) in nonfrozen sperm. Cryopreservation induced changes of all sperm parameters (P < 0.05). In contrast to all other sperm parameters, dichlorofluorescein-diacetate-fluoroescence indicating the synthesis of H2O2 showed a similar exponential rise (P < 0.05) like the %DFI values in frozen sperm.

To test this possibility, we investigated how variation in store-level food sales composition across Switzerland is associated with the mean Body Mass Index (BMI) of young men (Swiss Army conscripts) living near the stores. We obtained data on annual food sales (2011) for 553 stores from the largest supermarket chain in Switzerland, identified foods commonly regarded as \u201chealthy\u201d or \u201cunhealthy\u201d based on nutrient content, and determined their contribution to each store\u2019s total sales (Swiss francs).

However, gender could also play a crucial role in postural sway. Objectives: This study was used to examine (i) the impact of gender, surface type, and vision on postural sway; (ii) the effects of gender and vision on the limb symmetry of postural sway; and (iii) to understand the effects of gender, stance, surface type and vision on the alterations of dynamic postural sway alterations. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in which young, healthy men (n = 15) and women (n = 12) underwent a balance control assessment using a force plate (SATEL, 40 Hz). Postural stances were evaluated in different conditions: opened eyes (EO) and closed eyes (EC), on different surface foam vs. firm, a dominant leg stance (DL) vs. a non-dominant leg stance (NDL), and a mediolateral stance (ML) vs. an anteroposterior stance (AP). The mediolateral sway (ML sway), anteroposterior sway (AP sway), and sway area were calculated from the centre of pressure displacements. Results: ML sway, AP sway and sway area increased when eyes were closed (P < 0.000). Foam surface perturbs balance control more than firm surface under EO and EC conditions for both genders, as observed in the AP sway curve (P < 0.000). A functional symmetry exists between the DL and NDL for all sway parameters: the ML sway, AP sway, and sway area (P = 0.720; P = 0.292; P = 0.954). The AP stance is more stable for the ML sway than the ML stance for both genders (P < 0.001). For the AP sway, the ML stance is more stable than the AP sway AP direction stance for both genders (P < 0.001). Women were significantly more stable than men in the ML stance when vision was absent (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Postural sway was altered more significantly on a foam surface than on a firm surface and symmetry between the DL and NDL was observed.

Previously, we reported that increased food diversity introduced during the first year of life reduced the risk of atopic dermatitis.\r\nOBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated the association between the introduction of food during the first year of life and the development of asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, or atopic sensitization, taking precautions to address reverse causality. We further analyzed the association between food diversity and gene expression of T-cell markers and of C\u03b5 germline transcript, reflecting antibody isotype switching to IgE, measured at 6 years of age.\r\nMETHODS: Eight hundred fifty-six children who participated in a birth cohort study, Protection Against Allergy Study in Rural Environments\/EFRAIM, were included.

On the day before the start, 24 hours after the finish and then every 24 hours for the following 4 days, capillary blood samples at a fingertip were drawn to determine hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocytes, platelets, C-reactive protein, creatine kinase, creatinine and potassium and sodium. The runner achieved 26 laps during the 6 hours, equal to 24.304 km. Lap times increased continuously and running speed decreased nearly linearly. A large main effect of time point (hours) of the race on running speed was observed (=0.015, =0.48) with running speed being slower in the last hour than that in the first hour (3.5\u00b11.4 km\/h versus 5.3\u00b10.4 km\/h). Body mass decreased by 0.6%, percent body fat by 1.4% and fat-free mass by 0.7%. During recovery, hemoglobin, hematocrit and the number of thrombocytes increased, whereas the number of leukocytes remained unchanged. C-reactive protein was highest on day 1 after the race and decreased by day 4 nearly to zero. Creatine kinase was slightly elevated pre-race, highest the day after the race and remained slightly elevated until day 4. Creatinine and potassium were increased pre-race but returned to normal values during recovery. Sodium remained within normal values on all days. Based on the linear decrease in running speed, we extrapolated for the marathon distance to run a marathon in age group M95 (i.e., male marathoners aged 95-99 years). In the worst-case scenario (i.e., the athlete develops maximal fatigue), he would stop the race before 40 km, in the best scenario (i.e., the athlete develops minimal fatigue), he would achieve an overall race time of ~8.3 hours and in the most probable scenario (i.e., the athlete can continue in the same manner), the final race time will be longer than 11 hours.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/152559","SDG":0}

Among the practical limitations contributing to artifactual reconstructions are insufficient tomographic detection coverage and suboptimal illumination geometry, as well as inability to accurately account for acoustic reflections and speed of sound heterogeneities in the imaged tissues. Here we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach for enhancement of optoacoustic image quality which combines training on both time-resolved signals and tomographic reconstructions. Reference human finger data for training the CNN were recorded using a full-ring array system that provides optimal tomographic coverage around the imaged object. The reconstructions were further refined with a dedicated algorithm that minimizes acoustic reflection artifacts induced by acoustically mismatch structures, such as bones. The combined methodology is shown to outperform other learning-based methods solely operating on image-domain data.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/211573","SDG":0}

However, definitions for a narrow IAC vary widely and commonly, qualitative grading or two-dimensional measures are used to characterize a narrow IAC. We aimed to refine the definition of a narrow IAC by determining IAC volume in both control patients and patients with inner ear malformations (IEMs).\r\n\r\nMethods: In this multicentric study, we included high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans of 128 temporal bones (85 with IEMs: cochlear aplasia, n = 11; common cavity, n = 2; cochlear hypoplasia type, n = 19; incomplete partition type I\/III, n = 8\/8; Mondini malformation, n = 16; enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome, n = 19; 45 controls). The IAC diameter was measured in the axial plane and the IAC volume was measured by semi-automatic segmentation and three-dimensional reconstruction.\r\n\r\nResults: In controls, the mean IAC diameter was 5.5 mm (SD 1.1 mm) and the mean IAC volume was 175.3 mm3 (SD 52.6 mm3). Statistically significant differences in IAC volumes were found in cochlear aplasia (68.3 mm3, p < 0.0001), IPI (107.4 mm3, p = 0.04), and IPIII (277.5 mm3, p = 0.0004 mm3). Inter-rater reliability was higher in IAC volume than in IAC diameter (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.92 vs. 0.77).\r\n\r\nConclusions: Volumetric measurement of IAC in cases of IEMs reduces measurement variability and may add to classifying IEMs. Since a hypoplastic IAC can be associated with a hypoplastic cochlear nerve and sensorineural hearing loss, radiologic assessment of the IAC is crucial in patients with severe sensorineural hearing loss undergoing cochlear implantation.\r\n\r\nKeywords: 3D segmentation; Cochlear malformation; Diagnosis; Inner ear malformation; Internal auditory canal; Volume","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/221302","SDG":0}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:207982","TITLE":"Revisiting the Uniform Information Density Hypothesis","ABSTRACT":"The uniform information density (UID) hypothesis posits a preference among language users for utterances structured such that information is distributed uniformly across a signal. While its implications on language production have been well explored, the hypothesis potentially makes predictions about language comprehension and linguistic acceptability as well. Further, it is unclear how uniformity in a linguistic signal -- or lack thereof -- should be measured, and over which linguistic unit, e.g., the sentence or language level, this uniformity should hold. Here we investigate these facets of the UID hypothesis using reading time and acceptability data. While our reading time results are generally consistent with previous work, they are also consistent with a weakly super-linear effect of surprisal, which would be compatible with UID's predictions. For acceptability judgments, we find clearer evidence that non-uniformity in information density is predictive of lower acceptability. We then explore multiple operationalizations of UID, motivated by different interpretations of the original hypothesis, and analyze the scope over which the pressure towards uniformity is exerted. The explanatory power of a subset of the proposed operationalizations suggests that the strongest trend may be a regression towards a mean surprisal across the language, rather than the phrase, sentence, or document -- a finding that supports a typical interpretation of UID, namely that it is the byproduct of language users maximizing the use of a (hypothetical) communication channel.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/207982","SDG":0}

A promising neuroimaging approach is the animated shapes paradigm based on so-called Frith-Happ\u00e9 animations (FHAs) which trigger spontaneous mentalizing with minimal cognitive demands. Here, we presented FHAs during functional magnetic resonance imaging to 46 subjects and examined the specificity and sensitivity of the elicited social brain responses. Test-retest reliability was additionally assessed in 28 subjects within a two-week interval. Specific responses to spontaneous mentalizing were observed in key areas of the social brain with high sensitivity and independently from the variant low-level kinematics of the FHAs. Mentalizing-specific responses were well replicable on the group level, suggesting good-to-excellent cross-sectional reliability [intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs): 0.40-0.99; dice overlap at Puncorr<0.001: 0.26-1.0]. Longitudinal reliability on the single-subject level was more heterogeneous (ICCs of 0.40-0.79; dice overlap at Puncorr<0.001: 0.05-0.43). Posterior temporal sulcus activation was most reliable, including a robust differentiation between subjects across sessions (72% of voxels with ICC>0.40). These findings encourage the use of FHAs in neuroimaging research across developmental stages and psychiatric conditions, including the identification of biomarkers and pharmacological interventions.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/125733","SDG":0}

Drawing on 30 in-depth interviews with current and past social media users aged 21\u201339, the study finds that people discontinue, take breaks from, or change their use of social media for various reasons (e.g., lack of interest, overuse and overload, privacy concerns, social influences, keeping a work-life balance), but disconnection experiences vary greatly across individuals as well as within individuals over time. Notably, disconnection does not always follow negative experiences with social media, but can also be triggered by important life transitions or broader lifestyle choices. People also experience various practical, social, and societal challenges, making disconnection not always desirable or possible. Ultimately, this study gives insight into the factors that contribute to people\u2019s complex and ambivalent relationship with social media.

As military conscription in Israel is mandatory, all men in this study are military veterans. The main aims of the study were to explore the trajectories of marital adjustment over time and to describe similarities and differences in the marital adjustment of husbands and wives. Assessments were done at three time points over 12 years and were analyzed using a latent growth mixture model. Findings showed that overall husbands and wives reported being generally satisfied in their marriage. Different trajectories for husbands and wives were found in most domains of marital adjustment. The majority of wives reported a sharper decline in satisfaction over time, while more husbands reported an increase in affection. The wives reported more variability, as well as higher levels of consensus than their husbands across the 12 years of the study and the three data collection points. The spouses\u2019 high level of cohesion served to support their high levels of marital adjustment.

This claim, which is routinely taught in introductory cognitive psychology courses, is based entirely on pure-list between-subjects designs in which memory performance is equal for intentional and incidental learning groups. In the current 11 experiments, participants made semantic judgements about each word in a list but they had to remember only words presented in a specific color. We demonstrate that in such mixed-list designs there is a substantial difference between intentionally and incidentally learned items. The first four experiments show that this finding is independent of the remember cue onset relative to the semantic judgment. The remaining seven experiments test alternative explanations as to why intent only matters in mixed-list designs but not in pure-list designs\u2014inhibition of incidentally learned items, output interference, selective relational encoding, or selective threshold-shifting. We found substantial support for the threshold-shifting account according to which the intent to remember boosts item-context associations in both mixed- and pure-list designs; however, in pure-list between-subjects designs, participants in the incidental learning group can use a lower retrieval threshold to compensate for the weaker memory traces. This led to more extralist intrusions in incidental learning groups; incidental learning groups also showed a source memory deficit. We conclude that intent always matters for long-term learning, but that the effect is masked in traditional between-subjects designs. Our results suggest that researchers need to rethink the role of intent in long-term memory.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/233474","SDG":0}

In the present study, we ask whether those cues play a similar role later in children's acquisition of more complex pragmatic skills, such as politeness. 64 three- to five-year-old Catalan-dominant children participated in a request production task in four different conditions. They were prompted to request an object from either a classmate or an unfamiliar adult experimenter, with the implied cost of the request to the receiver's face thus being either high or low. Results showed that these preschool-age children used mitigating prosodic and gestural strategies to encode politeness earlier and more often than they used lexical or morphosyntactic markers, and that those cues develop incrementally during the preschool years. These findings suggest that prosody, gesture, and other body signals are an essential first step in the development of children's socio-pragmatic competence.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/185042","SDG":0}

We study the problem for Switzerland, where more than two thirds of the workforce gain vocational secondary degrees and a substantial number go on to a vocational tertiary degree but only a small share gain an academic tertiary degree. As outcome variables, we examine the risk of being unemployed, monthly earnings, and variation in earnings (reflecting financial risk). We study these outcomes at career entry and later stages. Our empirical results reveal that the type of tertiary education has various effects on these outcomes. At career entry, we observe equal unemployment risk but higher average wages and lower financial risk for vocational graduates. At later career stages, we find that these higher average wages disappear and risk of unemployment becomes lower for vocational graduates. Thus, by differentiating the tertiary system into vocational and academic institutions graduates face a variety of valuable options allowing them to self-select into an educational type that best matches their individual preferences.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/102332","SDG":4}

All these issues are discussed in relation to two main intellectual trends of archaeology to the present day: processual and post-processual archaeology. Processualism introduced and developed the idea of algorithmic and universal reasoning in archaeology, while post-processualism focused attention on the individual value of a monument and the archaeologist himself. These are still two foundations on which the present knowledge of the past is based, and thus their defining role cannot be overestimated. An additional layer of narrative, visible right from the beginning of the book, is the gradual discovery of the relationship between archaeology and popular culture, especially film and literature.

Although improved hygiene has reduced the risk of traveler's diarrhea in many destinations, the risk remains high in others.\r\nOBJECTIVE: To review the current state of knowledge on the etiology, risk factors, prevention, and management of traveler's diarrhea.\r\nEVIDENCE REVIEW: A search of the PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library databases for the period 2012-April 2014 was performed for articles on traveler's diarrhea. The database search yielded 2976 articles, of which 37 were included in this review. These were added to 85 articles previously identified by the authors.\r\nFINDINGS: Improved hygiene has reduced the risk of traveler's diarrhea from 20% or more (for a 2-week stay) to between 8% and 20% in some parts of the world. Acquiring traveler's diarrhea causes 12% to 46% of travelers to change their travel plans. Returning travelers seeking medical care have a diagnosis of gastrointestinal disturbance in approximately one-third of all cases. Postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome may occur in 3% to 17% of patients who have had traveler's diarrhea. Prevention of traveler's diarrhea by dietary avoidance measures is often not successful. Chemoprophylaxis should be restricted to travelers who are at risk of severe complications of diarrhea. Ciprofloxacin is the standard treatment in self-therapy of traveler's diarrhea except when patients are in South or Southeast Asia, where azithromycin is preferred.\r\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Diarrhea remains a common problem for international travelers. Persons intending to travel to at-risk countries should be counseled regarding prevention measures and may be given a travel pack that includes medications for self-treatment should they become ill.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/105181","SDG":3}

Detailed photophysical investigations of the complexes in solution, in neat solids and in PMMA films revealed the successful tuning of the emission quantum yield (\u03d5p) based on the electronic properties of the ancillary ligands. The catalytic photo-oxidation of benzylic amines to their corresponding imines using molecular oxygen as the oxidant was successfully achieved in the presence of the luminescent Au(III) complexes.

The strengths of the proposed approximation rely on the generic spatial discretization of the model equations using a continuous finite element type approximation technique, while avoiding the solution of a large linear system with a sparse mass matrix which would come along with any standard ODE solver in a classical finite element approach to advance the solution in time. In this work, we propose a new Residual Distribution (RD) scheme, which provides an arbitrary explicit high order approximation of the smooth solutions of the Euler equations both in space and time. The design of the scheme via the coupling of the RD formulation (Ricchiuto and Abgrall, 2010; Abgrall, 2006) with a Deferred Correction (DeC) type method (Liu et al., 2008; Minion, 2003), allows to have the matrix associated to the update in time, which needs to be inverted, to be diagonal. The use of Bernstein polynomials as shape functions, guarantees that this diagonal matrix is invertible and ensures strict positivity of the resulting diagonal matrix coefficients. This work is the extension of Abgrall et al. (2016) and Abgrall (2017) to multidimensional systems. We have assessed our method on several challenging benchmark problems for one- and two-dimensional Euler equations and the scheme has proven to be robust and to achieve the theoretically predicted high order of accuracy on smooth solutions.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/157550","SDG":0}

If the identification and categorization of segments of interest in document images have seen significant progress over the last years thanks to deep learning techniques, many challenges remain with, among others, the use of finer-grained segmentation typologies and the consideration of complex, heterogeneous documents such as historical newspapers. Besides, most approaches consider visual features only, ignoring textual signal. In this context, we introduce a multimodal approach for the semantic segmentation of historical newspapers that combines visual and textual features. Based on a series of experiments on diachronic Swiss and Luxembourgish newspapers, we investigate, among others, the predictive power of visual and textual features and their capacity to generalize across time and sources.

Tempo and mode of phenotypic changes in urban birds from Switzerland","ABSTRACT":"Humans' large influence on the environment has constructed many new ecological niches, such as in urban areas. Phenotypic changes, including morphological ones related to human influence, are known from a small number of bird species. The amount of change in a given time period, that is, the rate of change, may vary. Rates of change (both evolutionary and through phenotypic plasticity) are reportedly rapid in human-influenced settings, although this is disputed. We present new data on changes in beak dimensions and rates of change over historical time periods in four urban bird species (Common Chaffinch, European Greenfinch, Eurasian Blackbird, House Sparrow) from three Swiss cities (Basel, Bern, Geneva). Our study shows that beak dimensions have changed little in most investigated urban bird populations over the past century. Only in Genevan Blackbirds there was evidence for an increase in beak length over the past 65\u2009years; Bernese Chaffinches appear to be trending toward a decrease in beak width over the past 55\u2009years. Rates of change in our sample in comparison with literature records showed that compared to populations less influenced by humans, urban evolutionary rates appear to be similar. Although in accordance with previous findings about other urban bird species, our study exemplifies the difficulty to find universal patterns in tempo and mode of phenotypic evolution in urban areas, even when considering the same taxa. Our data contribute to the expanding field of urban evolutionary biology, which is particularly important regarding the growing urban habitats worldwide.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/220648","SDG":15}

But it can also have a hampering role, e.g., if investors' perceptions of low risk from a missed transition and low opportunities from a transition fail to trigger a reallocation of capital into low-carbon investments. This increases the chance of the transition not occurring within the time window required to stabilize the climate or occurring in a disorderly fashion. Indeed investors, who can influence the realization of climate mitigation pathways, themselves rely on estimates of climate mitigation pathways from process-based integrated assessment models (IAMs) (2). And IAMs do not model the financial system or investors' decisions; thus, the feedback loop between the financial system and mitigation pathways is not taken into account, neither by the IAMs nor by the finance community. This limitation to our understanding of the dynamics and the feasibility of the low-carbon transition weakens the ability of IAMs to inform policy and investment decisions. We propose a framework to capture the interdependence between investors' perception of future climate risk, depending on the credibility of climate policies, and the allocation of investments in the economy.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/208606","SDG":13}

Trends in flood types were studied with Sen\u2019s slope and double mass curves. Our results reveal a decreasing number of rain-on-snow and an increasing number of short rainfall events in all catchments, with flash floods increasing in smaller catchments.

Species persistence under climate change is determined by the combined effects of climatic factors on multiple demographic rates (survival, development and reproduction), and hence, population dynamics. Thus, to quantify which species and regions on Earth are most vulnerable to climate-driven extinction, a global understanding of how different demographic rates respond to climate is urgently needed.\r\n    Here, we perform a systematic review of literature on demographic responses to climate, focusing on terrestrial mammals, for which extensive demographic data are available.\r\n    To assess the full spectrum of responses, we synthesize information from studies that quantitatively link climate to multiple demographic rates. We find only 106 such studies, corresponding to 87 mammal species. These 87 species constitute <1% of all terrestrial mammals.\r\n    Our synthesis reveals a strong mismatch between the locations of demographic studies and the regions and taxa currently recognized as most vulnerable to climate change. Surprisingly, for most mammals and regions sensitive to climate change, holistic demographic responses to climate remain unknown. At the same time, we reveal that filling this knowledge gap is critical as the effects of climate change will operate via complex demographic mechanisms: a vast majority of mammal populations display projected increases in some demographic rates but declines in others, often depending on the specific environmental context, complicating simple projections of population fates.\r\n    Assessments of population viability under climate change are in critical need to gather data that account for multiple demographic responses, and coordinated actions to assess demography holistically should be prioritized for mammals and other taxa.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/216366","SDG":15}

Here, using a population genetic model, we investigate how female and male mate choice coevolve under a phenotype matching rule and how this affects reproductive isolation. We show that the evolution of female preferences increases the mating success of males with reciprocal preferences, favouring mutual mate choice. However, the evolution of male preferences weakens indirect selection on female preferences and, with weak genetic drift, the coevolution of female and male mate choice leads to periodic episodes of random mating with increased hybridization (deterministic \u2018preference cycling\u2019 triggered by stochasticity). Thus, counterintuitively, the process of establishing premating isolation proves rather fragile if both male and female mate choice contribute to assortative mating.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/183134","SDG":0}

The global distribution of these families makes this an excellent lineage to test if current distribution patterns are the result of vicariance or long-distance dispersal and to evaluate the roles of tertiary climatic and geological drivers in lineage diversification. Sequence data were generated from five chloroplast regions (petL-psbE, rbcL, rps16-trnK, trnL-trnLF, trnS-trnSG) for 104 ingroup species sampled across global diversity. The astelioid phylogeny was inferred using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference methods. Divergence dates were estimated with a relaxed clock applied in BEAST. Ancestral ranges were reconstructed in 'BioGeoBEARS' applying the corrected Akaike information criterion to test for the best-fit biogeographic model. Diversification rates were estimated in Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixtures [BAMM]. Astelioid relationships were inferred as Boryaceae(Blandfordiaceae(Asteliaceae(Hypoxidaceae plus Lanariaceae))). The crown astelioid node was dated to the Late Cretaceous (75.2 million years; 95% highest posterior densities interval 61.0-90.0 million years) with an inferred Eastern Gondwanan origin. However, astelioid speciation events have not been shaped by Gondwanan vicariance. Rather long-distance dispersal since the Eocene is inferred to account for current distributions. Crown Asteliaceae and Boryaceae have Australian ancestral ranges and diversified since the Eocene. In Hypoxidaceae, Empodium, Hypoxis, and Pauridia have African ancestral ranges; Curculigo and Molineria have an Asian ancestral range and have diversified since the mid-Miocene. Diversification of Pauridia and the Curculigo clade has occurred steadily, while diversification of Astelia and Hypoxis was punctuated over time. Diversification of those genera coincides temporally with the expansion of the habitat types occupied by extant taxa, e.g., grassland habitat in Africa during the late Miocene and alpine habitat in New Zealand during the Pliocene.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/204941","SDG":0}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:186757","TITLE":"Influencing factors on the foot health of captive Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in European zoos","ABSTRACT":"Pathological lesions of feet occur frequently in captive elephant populations. To improve foot health, it is important to identify risk factors associated with such pathologies. Several previous studies have analyzed potentially influencing factors but were limited, for example, by small sample sizes. This study analyzed the relationship between 87 independent variables and the foot health score of 204 Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in European zoos using bivariate correlation, multivariable regression models, and principal component analysis (PCA). Correlation and regression tests revealed significant results for 30 different variables, mainly with small effect sizes. Only three variables were significant in more than one test: sex, time spent indoors, and time spent on hard ground, with lower scores (i.e. less or less severe pathological lesions) in females, and when less time is spent indoors or on hard ground. Due to small effect sizes and differing results of the statistical tests, it is difficult to determine which risk factors are most important. Instead, a holistic consideration appears more appropriate. A biplot of the PCA shows that factors representing more advanced husbandry conditions (e.g. large areas, high proportions of sand flooring) were associated with each other and with decreased foot scores, whereas indicators of more limited conditions (e.g. high proportions of hard ground, much time spent indoors) were also associated with each other but increased the foot score. In conclusion, instead of resulting from just one or two factors, reduced foot health might be an indicator of a generally poorer husbandry system.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/186757","SDG":0}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:138548","TITLE":"Confrontational assessment in the roving male promiscuity mating system of the Bornean orangutan","ABSTRACT":"In many solitary mammalian species, females live alone in relatively small home ranges whereas males roam widely and converge around, and compete for matings with fertile females. In primates, orangutans are the only diurnal semi solitary species showing this roving male promiscuity mating system. Here, we develop and test hypotheses about the nature of male-male competition in Bornean orangutans by examining its sexually selected long-distance calls to disentangle the mechanisms through which males compete over mating access. This study uses a novel approach to disentangle the mechanisms of male-male competition. We established an acoustic localization system (ALS) comprising 20 recorders installed in a grid that allowed accurate localization in an area of 450 ha. With this procedure, we triangulated 1615 long calls over 109 days spread over 10 months to examine the males\u2019 ranging and calling decisions. A male\u2019s choice of area was determined mainly by local fruit availability. Once there, however, his calling behavior depended primarily on the number of sexually attractive females and the number of other flanged males present. Both these variables also predicted the proportion of calls to which individual males responded, and the proportion of males present that responded to long calls of other males. We conclude that intra-sexual competition among Bornean flanged males comprises a combination of contest and scramble competition best summarized as confrontational assessment.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/138548","SDG":0}

While other popular social media platforms were also used to spread conspiratorial, hateful and threatening content, Parler suffered the most consequences in the aftermath of the 2020 US presidential elections, having been singled out in the news coverage. Through a comparative study, we identify differences in content using #QAnon across three social media platforms, Parler, Twitter, and Gab, focusing on the volume, the amount of anti-social language, and the context of QAnon-related content over a month-long period. While the number of posts is the highest on Parler, this could be attributed to the differences in the use of hashtags on the platforms, which has consequences for other analyses. In our analysis, Parler exhibits the highest levels of anti-social language, while Gab has the highest proportion of #QAnon posts with hate terms. To get at qualitative differences in the posts, we perform analysis of named entities and narratives, focusing on differences in the focus of conversations and the levels of anti-social language of posts mentioning different groups of political figures.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/219386","SDG":0}

Ordinary Fascism \u2013 Contexts of Production and Reception","ABSTRACT":"Obyknovennyi fashizm \/ Ordinary Fascism (1965) is a Soviet film compiled from Nazi era film materials by Mikhail Romm together with Iurii Khaniutin and Maia Turovskaia. It was the first comprehensive attempt at a cinematic reflection on fascism and, implicitly, a post-Stalinist study of Soviet totalitarianism. As a key film of the 1960s it triggered a broad international debate that offers an insight into the discursive field of the political and ideological mirroring at the height of the Cold War period. Obyknovennyi fashizm is part of the \u201ccompilation film\u201d genre, which, simultaneously, both re-releases reinterprets historic imagery. It was assembled from two million meters of footage from Nazi newsreels, documentaries and kulturfilms, confiscated from the inventory of the Reich Film archive by the Red Army and transported to Moscow in 1945. This footage was complemented by photographs, for example portraits taken by Hitler\u2019s personal photographer Heinrich Hoffmann or private snapshots of soldiers of the German Wehrmacht that proved controversial in the first Wehrmacht Exhibition in the 1990s. This article deals with the film\u2019s protracted production history as well as its controversial reception both in the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. The analysis puts particular emphasis on the media strategies the film employs to achieve a critical reading of the Nazi footage, focusing on the interplay between visual montage and voice-over commentary as well as the use of other media forms (photography and writing). In the final part of the article Romm\u2019s film is examined in the context of other movies about National Socialism and the Holocaust, discussing earlier works including Alain Resnais\u2019 Nuit et brouillard \/ Night and Fog (1955, France), Erwin Leiser\u2019s Den blodiga tiden \/ Mein Kampf (1960, Sweden, Germany), and DEFA films and Polish documentaries as well as later examples such as the contemporary collage film Hitler\u2019s Hitparade (Oliver Axer and Susanne Benze, 2003, Germany).","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/127443","SDG":0}

In contrast, a more classical measure, a substantially increased interest rate, has no effect for most participants and raises the savings balance only for the very top of the distribution. A second experiment, conducted a year later, tests an alternative delivery mechanism and shows that effects of similar size can be achieved through feedback text messages, without meetings, rewards, or peer pressure.

We focus on two irreversible options, namely quinoa variety management andWaruWaru. The former alternative considers the option of the farmer to switch from his business-as-usual quinoa variety to one that has different yield and frost resistance characteristics. The latter alternative refers to the implementation of an ancestral cultivation practice that is estimated to offer benefits in terms of yield increase and resistance to harsh climate conditions.\r\nWe rely on Real Options Analysis to assess the two types of investment opportunities for the farmer. This approach allows us to determine not only whether the investments should be undertaken or not, but also the optimal timing to do so. We find that one quinoa variety (Kancolla) offers the highest benefits to the farmer and switching to this option should be immediate if investment costs are low; however, as costs increase, the decision to switch quinoa variety is optimally postponed until quinoa price uncertainty is reduced. We find that the Waru Waru option is not worth undertaking unless further evidence related to the increase in the productivity of quinoa is developed. However, at increases in productivity above 20%, the Waru Waru option becomes highly attractive. The article also discusses how quinoa price dynamics, yield sensitivity to frost, and governmental support impact decisions of the smallholder farmer.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/157456","SDG":2}

B. thuringiensis strains frequently harbor enterotoxin genes. However, the organism has only very rarely been associated with foodborne outbreaks, possibly due to the fact that during outbreak investigations, B. cereus is routinely not differentiated from B. thuringiensis. A recent EFSA scientific opinion stresses the urgent need for further data allowing for improved risk assessment, in particular as B. thuringiensis is a commonly used biopesticide. Therefore, the aim of this study was to gain further insights into the hazardous potential of B. thuringiensis. To this end, 39 B. thuringiensis isolates obtained from commercially used biopesticides, various food sources, as well as from foodborne outbreaks were characterized by panC typing, panC-based SplitsTree analysis, toxin gene profiling, FTIR spectroscopic analysis, a cytotoxicity assay screening for enterotoxic activity, and a sphingomyelinase assay. The majority of the tested B. thuringiensis isolates exhibited low (23%, n = 9) or mid level enterotoxicity (74%, n = 29), and produced either no (59%, n = 23) or low levels (33%, n = 13) of sphingomyelinase, which is reported to act synergistically with enterotoxins Nhe and Hbl. One strain isolated from rosemary was however classified as highly enterotoxic surpassing the cytotoxic activity of the high-level reference strain by a factor of 1.5. This strain also produced vast amounts of sphingomyelinase. Combining all results obtained in this study into a fingerprint pattern, several enterotoxic biopesticide strains were indistinguishable from those of isolates from foods or collected in association with outbreaks. Our study shows that many B. thuringiensis biopesticide strains exhibit mid-level cytotoxicity in a Vero cell assay and that some of these strains cannot be differentiated from isolates collected from foods or in association with outbreaks. Thus, we demonstrate that the use of B. thuringiensis strains as biopesticides can represent a food safety risk, underpinning the importance of assessing the hazardous potential of each strain and formulation used.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/168066","SDG":2}

Although the soil microbiota is known to play a key role in the resulting plant-soil feedbacks, the proximal mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unknown. We found that benzoxazinoids, a class of defensive secondary metabolites that are released by roots of cereals such as wheat and maize, alter root-associated fungal and bacterial communities, decrease plant growth, increase jasmonate signaling and plant defenses, and suppress herbivore performance in the next plant generation. Complementation experiments demonstrate that the benzoxazinoid breakdown product 6-methoxy-benzoxazolin-2-one (MBOA), which accumulates in the soil during the conditioning phase, is both sufficient and necessary to trigger the observed phenotypic changes. Sterilization, fungal and bacterial profiling and complementation experiments reveal that MBOA acts indirectly by altering root-associated microbiota. Our results reveal a mechanism by which plants determine the composition of rhizosphere microbiota, plant performance and plant-herbivore interactions of the next generation.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/168377","SDG":0}

It remains unclear to what extent organic and conventional farming practices, differing in organic matter management, influence Zn availability and uptake by wheat grains. Factors leading to an increased Zn uptake may also increase the Cd uptake in wheat grains, which are a major source of harmful Cd for humans. In this study, we investigated the effects of different farming practices on Zn and Cd concentrations in wheat grains and their relationships with total and available soil Zn and Cd concentrations, and other soil properties. In northern Switzerland, 28 farms were sampled including 11 organic farms with compost use, 10 organic farms without compost use, and 7 conventional farms without compost use. Soil organic matter was a key factor for soil Zn and especially Cd concentrations across all three farming systems. Total and available soil Cd concentrations as well as soil organic carbon concentration (SOC) were significantly higher on the organic farms with compost use than on the conventional farms. However, only the compost farms with livestock showed significantly higher grain Cd concentrations in comparison to conventional farming, whereas the organic farms without compost use were in between. In contrast to Cd, the soil and grain Zn concentrations showed no significant farming system effect although there was a correlation between total soil Zn and SOC when all farms of the survey were pooled. Grain Zn was decoupled from soil Zn indicating that under agricultural field conditions the farming systems are a minor factor in increasing grain Zn. Our study suggests that the Zn and Cd soil and grain concentrations on farms were mediated by a combination of on-farm organic matter management, soil properties, and livestock production intensity.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/168376","SDG":2}

Little is known to which extent and how specifically soil and plant microbiomes can be manipulated through different cropping practices. Here, we investigated soil and wheat root microbial communities in a cropping system experiment consisting of conventional and organic managements, both with different tillage intensities.\r\nResults While microbial richness was marginally affected, we found pronounced cropping effects on community composition, which were specific for the respective microbiomes. Soil bacterial communities were primarily structured by tillage, whereas soil fungal communities responded mainly to management type with additional effects by tillage. In roots, management type was also the driving factor for bacteria but not for fungi, which were generally determined by changes in tillage intensity. To quantify an \u201ceffect size\u201d for microbiota manipulation, we found that about 10% of variation in microbial communities was explained by the tested cropping practices. Cropping sensitive microbes were taxonomically diverse, and they responded in guilds of taxa to the specific practices. These microbes also included frequent community members or members co-occurring with many other microbes in the community, suggesting that cropping practices may allow manipulation of influential community members.\r\nConclusions Understanding the abundance patterns of cropping sensitive microbes presents the basis towards developing microbiota management strategies for smart farming. For future targeted microbiota management\u2014e.g., to foster certain microbes with specific agricultural practices\u2014a next step will be to identify the functional traits of the cropping sensitive microbes.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/168385","SDG":2}

Most assessments in agricultural systems focus on plant yield. Yet, these analyses neglect temporal yield stability, or the variability and reliability of production across years. Here we perform a meta-analysis to assess temporal yield stability of three major cropping systems: organic agriculture and conservation agriculture (no-tillage) vs. conventional agriculture, comparing 193 studies based on 2896 comparisons. Organic agriculture has, per unit yield, a significantly lower temporal stability (\u221215%) compared to conventional agriculture. Thus, although organic farming promotes biodiversity and is generally more environmentally friendly, future efforts should focus on reducing its yield variability. Our analysis further indicates that the use of green manure and enhanced fertilisation can reduce the yield stability gap between organic and conventional agriculture. The temporal stability (\u22123%) of no-tillage does not differ significantly from those of conventional tillage indicating that a transition to no-tillage does not affect yield stability.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/166251","SDG":0}

Each of the 17 functional Pm3 alleles identified so far confers resistance to a distinct spectrum of Bgt isolates. Variant Pm3e has been found in wheat donor line W150 and differs only by two amino acids from the non-functional variant Pm3CS. In order to evaluate the capability of Pm3e to provide powdery mildew field resistance, we generated transgenic Pm3e lines by biolistic transformation of the powdery mildew susceptible spring wheat cultivar Bobwhite. Field trials conducted during four field seasons in Switzerland showed significant and strong powdery mildew resistance of the Pm3e transgenic lines, whereas the corresponding biological sister lines, not containing the transgene, were severely powdery mildew infected. Thus Pm3e alone is responsible for the strong resistance phenotype. The field grown transgenic lines showed high transgene expression and Pm3e protein accumulation with no fitness costs on plant development and yield associated with Pm3e abundance. Line E#1 as well as sister line E#1 showed delayed flowering due to somaclonal variation. The study shows the capability of Pm3e in providing strong powdery mildew field resistance, making its use in wheat breeding programs very promising.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/160634","SDG":2}

The highly fragmented B.g. tritici genome available so far has prevented a systematic analysis of effector genes that are known to be involved in host adaptation. To study the diversity and evolution of effector genes we produced a chromosome\u2010scale assembly of the B.g. tritici genome.  The genome assembly and annotation was achieved by combining long\u2010read sequencing with high\u2010density genetic mapping, bacterial artificial chromosome fingerprinting and transcriptomics. We found that the 166.6 Mb B.g. tritici genome encodes 844 candidate effector genes, over 40% more than previously reported. Candidate effector genes have characteristic local genomic organization such as gene clustering and enrichment for recombination\u2010active regions and certain transposable element families. A large group of 412 candidate effector genes shows high plasticity in terms of copy number variation in a global set of 36 isolates and of transcription levels.  Our data suggest that copy number variation and transcriptional flexibility are the main drivers for adaptation in B.g. tritici. The high repeat content may play a role in providing a genomic environment that allows rapid evolution of effector genes with selection as the driving force.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/160633","SDG":0}

Early prediction of mycotoxin levels is important for farmers and the cereal industry to minimize the risk of contaminated food and feed. Therefore, climate chamber experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of different temperatures (10, 15, 20 \u00b0C) and durations (4, 8, 12 h) at 99% relative humidity (RH) on the infection of oats with FP and FL. In addition, to discover the most susceptible period of oats, artificial FL inoculations were conducted at different growth stages. Field experiments were performed to observe the dispersal of these fungal species within the field and to investigate the weather conditions that influence the dispersal. The climate chamber experiments revealed higher contamination with NIV and T\u20102\/HT\u20102 in the 10 \u00b0C treatments and with a prolonged humidity duration of 12 h 99% RH. Inoculations of oat plants at early (DC 61) and mid (DC 65) anthesis, led to higher FL infection and T\u20102\/HT\u20102 accumulation in the grains compared with treatments at earlier growth stages, which might be due to an increased susceptibility during anthesis.

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:170833","TITLE":"The evolution of daily food sharing: A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis","ABSTRACT":"Some human subsistence economies are characterized by extensive daily food sharing networks, which may buffer the risk of shortfalls and facilitate cooperative production and divisions of labor among households. Comparative studies of human food sharing can assess the generalizability of this theory across time, space, and diverse lifeways. Here we test several predictions about daily sharing norms\u2013which presumably reflect realized cooperative behavior\u2013in a globally representative sample of nonindustrial societies (the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample), while controlling for multiple sources of autocorrelation among societies using Bayesian multilevel models. Consistent with a risk-buffering function, we find that sharing is less likely in societies with alternative means of smoothing production and consumption such as animal husbandry, food storage, and external trade. Further, food sharing was tightly linked to labor sharing, indicating gains to cooperative production and perhaps divisions of labor. We found a small phylogenetic signal for food sharing (captured by a supertree of human populations based on genetic and linguistic data) that was mediated by food storage and social stratification. Food sharing norms reliably emerge as part of cooperative economies across time and space but are culled by innovations that facilitate self-reliant production.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/170833","SDG":2}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168382","TITLE":"Improvement of soil structure through organic crop management, conservation tillage and grass-clover ley","ABSTRACT":"Conventional tillage is a widespread soil management practice that controls weeds and promotes nutrient mineralization at the expense of a degraded soil structure and soil carbon (C) loss. Although C dynamics and soil structure are widely recognized as pivotal to essential environmental and crop-related agroecosystem processes such as belowground C storage and crop root establishment, there is still a need to evaluate cropping practices most favorable for soil structure. For example, the effects on soil structure by continuous intensive tillage after a ley period remains unclear. To address these issues, we measured mean weight diameter, total C and total nitrogen (N) in whole soil and water-stable aggregate fractions after a 4-year arable crop rotation on a Cambisol where organic and conventional management was combined with intensive tillage and different types of conservation tillage. Measurements were repeated following a 2-year grass-clover ley period. Results showed that 4 years of organic management (including the application of cattle manure slurry) combined with reduced tillage significantly improved soil structure through increasing the proportion of large macroaggregates and hence the aggregate mean weight diameter (MWD) in the 0-6 cm soil layer. Although an increase in MWD after ley was observed in organic intensive tillage and a marginal increase in conventional intensive tillage, a significant increase in total C was observed only for the organic cropping systems, which also showed a high C stratification between 0-6 cm and 6-20 cm depth. Thus, a ley period enhances soil structure after continuous cropping under intensive tillage and when organic management is combined with reduced tillage. In conclusion, soil structure is best maintained when combining organic management with reduced tillage due to additive effects.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/168382","SDG":2}

Using an interpersonal perspective, we examined the effects of support provision and receipt on same-day physical activity, and studied the role of partners' joint engagement in activities. One hundred nineteen heterosexual couples reported on target persons' received and partners' provided support across 28 diary days, yielding 2,854 valid days. A dyadic report on couples' joint engagement was obtained from a subset of 88 couples. Target persons' daily activity was objectively assessed via accelerometers. On days with high versus low levels of provided support, target persons' activity was 25 min higher. Support receipt mediated 20% of this effect. Joint engagement accounted for around half of the effects of provided and received support. Support provision is uniquely linked to goal implementation in everyday life. Joint engagement in activities may be one explanation for how support is facilitated.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/142317","SDG":0}

A prospective parent-child study explaining physical activity\u00a0and body fat among children","ABSTRACT":"Objectives: Research explaining childhood obesity has been usually focused on cognitive and behavioral predictors assessed in parents only or in children only. In contrast, the dyadic approach allows to evaluate how parental and child predictors operate together to explain child physical activity (PA) and body fat. This study investigated relationships among: (1) parental and child perceptions of accessibility and safety of exercise facilities for children, (2) parental and child PA, and (3) parental and child body fat percentage.\r\n\r\nDesign: A prospective and dyadic study with two measurement points was conducted. The follow up (Time 2) took place at 7\u20138-month after the baseline (Time 1).\r\n\r\nMethods: Data were collected among 922 dyads of parents (mean age 35.97 years old; 83.9% women) and children (aged 6\u201311; M = 8.42, 52% girls). Parents and children reported safety and accessibility perceptions (Time 1) and PA (Time 1 and 2). Parental and child body fat were measured objectively (Time 1 and 2).\r\n\r\nResults: Path analysis showed that parental perceptions of accessibility of PA facilities for children (Time 1) predicted child body fat and PA (Time 2). The associations were significant in a model accounting for longitudinal and cross-sectional associations between parental and child body fat and PA, controlling for age and gender of parents and children. Similar patterns of associations were found in the subsamples of dyads with children with normal body weight and with children with overweight\/obesity.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Parental, not child perceptions of accessibility of PA facilities predicted child PA and body fat.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/142331","SDG":0}

A Roadmap for an Evidence-Based Answer","ABSTRACT":"Two seemingly associated demographic trends have generated considerable interest: income stagnation and rising premature mortality from suicides, drug poisoning, and alcoholic liver disease among US non-Hispanic Whites with low education. Economists interpret these population-level trends to indicate that despair induced by financial stressors is a shared pathway to these causes of death. Although we now have the catchy term \"deaths of despair,\" we have yet to study its central empirical claim: that conceptually defined and empirically assessed \"despair\" is indeed a common pathway to several causes of death. At the level of the person, despair consists of cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and biological domains. Despair can also permeate social relationships, networks, institutions, and communities. Extant longitudinal data sets feature repeated measures of despair-before, during, and after the Great Recession-offering resources to test the role that despair induced by economic decline plays in premature morbidity and mortality. Such tests must also focus on protective factors that could shield individuals.  is more than a phrase; it constitutes a hypothesis that deserves conceptual mapping and empirical study with longitudinal, multilevel data.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/171042","SDG":0}

Given the paucity of research during this important developmental period, this study investigated the association between CHCs and chronic disruptive pain among emerging adults and the extent to which psychiatric disorders moderate this association.\r\nMETHODS: Data come from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey - Mental Health (CCHS-MH). This cross-sectional survey included 5987 participants that were 15-30 years of age and self-reported their CHCs (n=2460, 41%) and the extent to which pain impacted daily functioning using items from the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI 3). Group comparisons between respondents with CHCs and healthy controls were made using chi-square tests. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed from ordinal logistic regression models adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. Product-term interactions between CHCs and psychiatric disorders were included in the models to explore moderating effects. All analyses were weighted to maintain representativeness of the study sample to the Canadian population.\r\nRESULTS: The mean age of participants was 23.5 (SE 0.1) years and 48% were female. Compared to healthy controls, a greater proportion of participants with CHCs reported having chronic pain (20.3% vs. 4.5%, p<0.001). Among those with chronic pain, respondents with CHCs reported a greater number of activities prevented because of chronic disruptive pain (\u03c72=222.28, p<0.001). Similarly, in logistic regression models, participants with CHCs had greater odds of reporting chronic disruptive pain (OR=4.94, 95% CI=4.08-5.99). Alcohol (\u03b2=-0.66; p=0.025) and drug abuse\/dependence disorders (\u03b2=-1.24; p=0.012) were found to moderate the association between CHCs and chronic disruptive pain. Specifically, the probability of chronic disruptive pain was higher for emerging adults without CHCs and with alcohol or drug disorders; however, among participants with CHCs, probability was higher for those without these disorders.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: There is a robust association between CHCs and chronic disruptive pain. The moderating effects suggest that alcohol or drug disorders are especially harmful for emerging adults without CHCs and contribute to higher levels of chronic disruptive pain; however, among those with CHCs, alcohol and illicit drugs may be used as a numbing agent to blunt chronic disruptive pain.\r\nIMPLICATIONS: Findings from this study have implications for the integration and coordination of services to design strategies aimed at managing chronic disruptive pain and preventing pain-related disabilities later in life. Within the health system, healthcare providers should engage in dialogues about mental health and substance use regularly with emerging adults, be proactive in screening for psychiatric disorders, and continue to monitor the impact of pain on daily functioning. Given the age range of emerging adults, there is tremendous opportunity for clinicians to work cooperatively with colleagues in the education system to support emerging adults with and without CHCs. Overall, clinicians, researchers, educators, and those in social services should continue to be mindful of the complex interrelationships between physical and mental health and chronic disruptive pain and work cooperatively to optimize health outcomes and prevent pain-related disabilities among emerging adults.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/148344","SDG":0}

This study describes the development of the KERI-D (Kodierbogen zur Erfassung R\u00fcckfallprophylaktischer Interventionen bei Depression\/Coding System to Assess Interventions of Relapse Prevention in Depression). The KERI-D is a new observer-based rating tool for acute or continuation\/maintenance-phase sessions and assesses relapse-prevention elements including implementation into patient's daily routines.\r\nMETHODS\r\nThe development of the KERI-D included iterative steps referring to theoretical, clinical and empirical sources. It consists of 19 content items within four categories (self-care, early warning signs, triggering events\/situations, termination of therapy) and one global item. For empirical analyses, videotaped psychotherapy sessions of 36 psychotherapies were rated by three independent observers and analyzed for their psychometric properties.\r\nRESULTS\r\nMost items showed moderate to good inter-rater reliability (median ICC = .80) and retest reliability (median ICC = .93). Principal-axis factor analysis revealed three subscales, and first evidence of content validity was demonstrated. No associations with clinical follow-up data were found.\r\nLIMITATIONS\r\nAnalysis was limited to a relatively small sample of selected psychotherapy sessions. Evaluation of predictive validity is a desirable next step to further examine applicability and scope of the instrument.\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nThe KERI-D is the first observer-based rating instrument measuring specific relapse-prevention strategies in psychotherapy for depression. It may help to identify elements that prove effective in reducing relapse\/recurrence in the long-term and thereby help to optimize effect duration of depression treatment.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/164827","SDG":0}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:148159","TITLE":"Amylin - its role in the homeostatic and hedonic control of eating and recent developments of amylin analogs to treat obesity","ABSTRACT":"BACKGROUND: Amylin is a pancreatic \u03b2-cell hormone that produces effects in several different organ systems. One of its best-characterized effects is the reduction in eating and body weight seen in preclinical and clinical studies. Amylin activates specific receptors, a portion of which it shares with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Amylin's role in the control of energy metabolism relates to its satiating effect, but recent data indicate that amylin may also affect hedonic aspects in the control of eating, including a reduction of the rewarding value of food. Recently, several amylin-based peptides have been characterized. Pramlintide (Symlin\u00ae) is currently the only one being used clinically to treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However other amylin analogs with improved pharmacokinetic properties are being considered as anti-obesity treatment strategies. Several other studies in obesity have shown that amylin agonists could also be useful for weight loss, especially in combination with other agents.\r\nSCOPE OF REVIEW: This review will briefly summarize amylin physiology and pharmacology and then focus on amylin's role in food reward and the effects of amylin analogs in pre-clinical testing for anti-obesity drugs.\r\nCONCLUSION: We propose here that the effects of amylin may be homeostatic and hedonic in nature.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/148159","SDG":0}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:152882","TITLE":"Considering our methods: Methodological issues with rodent models of appetite and obesity research","ABSTRACT":"A large number of animal models are currently used in appetite and obesity research. Because the worldwide incidence of obesity continues to climb, it is imperative that animal models sharing characteristics of human obesity and its co-morbidities be used appropriately in the quest for novel preventions or treatments. There is probably no animal model, at least in rodents, that recapitulates all aspects of \"common\" human obesity and its comorbidities, but rodent models allow insight into specific mechanisms of disease or its consequences. Frequently used obesity models can be partitioned into different categories, the major ones being a) based on mutations or manipulations of one or a few individual genes or b) those in genetically intact animals exposed to obesogenic environments such as, e.g., being maintained on high-fat diets or being raised in small litters. Characteristics of these models include distinct phenotypes of obesity, hyperphagia or changes in energy metabolism, and frequent comorbidities of obesity, like hyperglycemia, insulin resistance or diabetes-like syndromes. This review which is based on a presentation given during the Annual Meeting of the Society for the Study of Ingestive Behavior in July 2017 points out some observations and characteristics of rodent models in obesity and diabetes research. The choice of rodent models discussed here is subjective and based on the author's own experience or on fruitful discussions with colleagues about the pros and cons of specific models. Hence, this review, by no means, is meant to give a complete picture of rodent models used in this type of research, but the review tries to bring up some issues which, in the author's mind, may also be relevant for models not discussed here. For example, by discussing specific mouse and rat models, similarities and differences between mice and rats will be discussed that need to be considered to interpret experimental findings cautiously and in the context of the respective animal model. Knowing which animal model to use means, knowing its limitations.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/152882","SDG":0}

Forty-six (71.9%) of the isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR). Among the ESBL producers, blaCTX-M-15 (n\u202f=\u202f17\/48.6% of the blaESBLs), blaCTX-M-1 (n\u202f=\u202f10\/28.6%), blaCTX-M-55 (n\u202f=\u202f4\/11.4%), blaCTX-M-14 (n\u202f=\u202f3\/8.6%), and blaCTX-M-27 (n\u202f=\u202f1\/2.9%) were identified. The plasmid-mediated fluoroquinolone resistance genes aac(6')-Ib-cr, qnrB and the azithromycin resistance gene mph(A) were detected in 17 (26.6% of all isolates), one (1.6%) and in 13 (20.3%) respectively. The most frequent phylogenetic groups were C (n\u202f=\u202f19) and B2 (n\u202f=\u202f15). Twenty-six different sequence types (STs) were identified, with two being novel. The most frequent STs were ST410 (n\u202f=\u202f16\/25%), ST131, and ST73 (both n\u202f=\u202f5\/7.8%), and ST361 (n\u202f=\u202f4\/6.3%). Ten (15.6%) of the STs have been associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) in humans, suggesting zoonotic potential. Among seven virulence-associated genes, fyuA was the most prevalent. The overall aggregate virulence factor (VF) score was highest for isolates belonging to phylogenetic group B2 (median aggregate VF score 6, mean score 5,5, range 3-7), and lowest for isolates belonging to phylogenetic group C (0\/ 0.5\/0-3). The most frequent ST in this study, ST410, harboured the lowest number of VF (0\/0,3\/0-2). VF scores were higher in NDR (4\/3.8\/3-4) than in MDR (1\/1,9\/0-7), and higher in non-ESBL producing isolates (3\/3\/0-7) than in ESBL producers (1\/1,7\/0-7). Our data advance our knowledge of the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of UPEC in companion animals and their potential for infection, zoonotic transmission and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance determinants.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/167650","SDG":0}

With regard to Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia (E.) coli, and coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS), the examined products were generally of a good microbiological quality. Enterobacteriaceae were found in seven cheeses (1.0\u00d7102 \u2013 8.8\u00d7104 CFU\/g) and one sausage (2.0\u00d7102 CFU\/g). Three of these cheeses were also positive for E. coli. CPS results were comparable for cheeses (5.9%; 1.0-6.0\u00d7102 CFU\/g) and meat products (3.8%; 1.0-2.0\u00d7102 CFU\/g). On the other hand, such raw products may harbor potential health hazards as Listeria (L.) monocytogenes, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), and staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE)-producing Staphylococcus (S.) aureus. L. monocytogenes were found in one sausage and the isolate belonged to the serotype 1\/2c. The two STEC isolates harbored stx1a (cheese) or stx2e (sausage), but both lacked eae and did not belong to the top five-serogroups. Of the five S. aureus isolates, the three cheese isolates belonged to the clonal complex (CC) 8, CC22, and CC705, the two sausage isolates belonged to CC7, and all isolates harbored genes for SEs. Thus, to avoid contaminations and to prevent foodborne pathogens from entering the food chain, strict compliance with good hygiene practices during milk and cheese production or meat production is of central importance.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/168068","SDG":0}

Battalion kitchens or army catering facilities present a food safety risk, as temperature abuse and long storage time can result in serious public health problems affecting a high number of served people. In contrast to civil catering facilities, no microbiological monitoring systems are currently implemented in Swiss military kitchens. In this study toxin gene profiles and cytotoxicity levels of 21 isolates of B. cereus originating from six different food categories were determined. Nearly all isolates (95%) harbored the nhe gene, whereas no hbl could be detected. Seven isolates displayed the cytK2 gene and one cereulide-producer was isolated out of vegetables. While most isolates displayed low cytotoxicity, highly cytotoxic strains were detected, with three isolates even exceeding the cytotoxicity level of the reference strain for high-level toxin production, underpinning that cytotoxicity cannot be deduced only from presence or absence of toxin genes. These findings further underline the importance of rapid cooling of foods or maintenance over 65\u00b0C before serving. This is especially important in mass catering facilities, such as military kitchens, in which food is often prepared a long time in advance.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/167858","SDG":0}

In Uganda, seropositivity has been reported in both humans and domesticated animals, including cattle. However, it remains unknown whether cattle are shedding leptospires and thus acting as potential source for human leptospirosis. We conducted this cross-sectional study in two cattle abattoirs in Kampala, Uganda between June and July 2017. Kidney and urine samples from 500 cattle sourced from across the country were analysed by real-time PCR to establish the prevalence of Leptospira-positive cattle and risk of exposure to abattoir workers. The species of infecting Leptospira was determined by amplification of secY gene and compared to reference sequences published in GenBank. Of 500 cattle tested, 36 (7.2%) had Leptospira DNA in their kidneys (carriers), 29 (5.8%) in their urine (shedders); with an overall prevalence (kidney and\/or urine) of 8.8%. Leptospira borgpetersenii was confirmed as the infecting species in three cattle and Leptospira kirschneri in one animal. Male versus female cattle (OR = 3, p-value 0.003), exotic versus local breeds (OR = 21.3, p-value 0.002) or cattle from Western Uganda (OR = 4.4, p-value 0.001) and from regions across the border (OR = 3.3, p-value 0.032) versus from the central region were more likely to be Leptospira-positive. The daily risk of exposure of abattoir workers to \u22651 (kidney and\/or urine) positive carcass ranged from 27% (95% credibility interval 18.6-52.3) to 100% (95% CI 91.0-100.0), with halal butchers and pluck inspectors being at highest risk. In conclusion, cattle slaughtered at abattoirs in Uganda carry and shed pathogenic Leptospira species; and this may pose occupation-related risk of exposure among workers in these abattoirs, with workers who handle larger numbers of animals being at higher risk.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/171543","SDG":0}

Official reports document an animal incidence in Kazakhstan of about 0.6% per year, and the country still registers high number of human cases annually . The main objective of this paper was to evaluate the distribution and economic impact of brucellosis in Kazakhstan. We analysed human disease incidence data obtained from the Government Sanitary & Epidemiological Service with the aim to estimate the burden of disease in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). We also estimated the economic impact in terms of monetary losses. Additionally, we mapped the geographical distribution of the disease throughout Kazakhstan. In total, 1,334 human cases of brucellosis were registered in 2015 in Kazakhstan that resulted in 713 DALYs. Around US Dollar 21 million was spent on compensation for animals that had to be slaughtered due to brucellosis, and an additional US Dollar 24 million was spent on testing animals. Animal brucellosis and human brucellosis occur throughout the whole country, some trends of which are reviewed in this paper. We estimated the burden of the disease and explored possible explanation for high human incidence rates. This paper is the first to estimate the human burden of disease and the economic costs in Kazakhstan. Both of these are substantial.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/170972","SDG":3}

Where no data were available for a country within this period, published data from 1985-1990 were also accessed.\r\nRESULTS: From 10,786 articles initially scanned, we retrieved 98 full-text articles from which data were extracted. In addition, two unpublished datasets were provided on the incidence of human taeniosis. Data for human taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis were found for all countries except Turkmenistan. Human taeniosis prevalence varied from undetected to over 5.3%, with regional variations. Where bovine cysticercosis was detected, prevalences varied from case reports to 25%.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: The public health burden of T. saginata is assumed to be small as the parasite is of low pathogenicity to humans. However, this review indicates that infection continues to be widespread and this may result in a large economic burden, due to the resources utilized in meat inspection and condemnation or processing with subsequent downgrading of infected carcasses.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/170443","SDG":0}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:128210","TITLE":"Health and skill formation in early childhood","ABSTRACT":"This paper analyzes the developmental origins and the evolution of health, cognitive, and socio-emotional skills during early childhood, from age 0 to 5. We explicitly model the dynamic interactions of health with the child\u2019s behavior and cognitive skills, as well as the role of parental investment. A dynamic factor model corrects for the presence of measurement error in the proxy for the latent traits. Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), we find that children\u2019s capabilities strongly interact and build on each other: health is an important determinant of early socio-emotional development; in turn socio-emotional skills have a positive impact on the evolution of both health and cognitive functions; on the other side, the effect of cognitive abilities on health is negligible. Furthermore, all facets of human capital display a high degree of persistence. Finally, mother\u2019s investments are an important determinant of the child\u2019s health, cognitive, and socio-emotional development early in life.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/128210","SDG":0}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:157090","TITLE":"Day-to-day mastery and self-efficacy changes during a smoking quit attempt: Two studies","ABSTRACT":"OBJECTIVE: In social-cognitive theory, it is hypothesized that mastery experiences (successfully implementing behaviour change) are a source of self-efficacy, and self-efficacy increases the opportunity for experiencing mastery. Vicarious experiences (seeing others succeed) are suggested as another source of self-efficacy. However, the hypothesis of this reciprocal relationship has not been tested using a day-to-day design.\r\n\r\nDESIGN: This article reports findings from two intensive longitudinal studies, testing the reciprocal relationship of self-efficacy and its two main sources within the naturally occurring process of quitting smoking (without intervention). Smokers (Study 1: N\u00a0=\u00a0100 smokers in smoker-non-smoker couples (1,787 observations); Study 2; N\u00a0=\u00a081 female (1,401 observations) and N\u00a0=\u00a079 male smokers (1,328 observations) in dual-smoker couples) reported their mastery experiences (not smoking the entire day; in Study 2, mastery experience of partner served as vicarious experience) and smoking-specific self-efficacy for 21\u00a0days after a self-set quit date.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Time-lagged multilevel analyses were conducted using change-predicting-change models.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Increases in mastery experiences predicted changes in self-efficacy, and increases in self-efficacy predicted changes in mastery experiences in Study 1. Study 2 replicated these results and showed contagion effects (partners' mastery on individuals' mastery and partners' self-efficacy on individuals' self-efficacy), but found no evidence for a link between vicarious experiences (partners' mastery experiences) and individuals' self-efficacy.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: This article demonstrates that mastery experiences and self-efficacy show a reciprocal relationship within smokers during a quit attempt in a day-to-day design, as well as contagion effects in couples when both partners try to quit simultaneously. Statement of Contribution What is already known on this subject? Self-efficacy is one of the strongest correlates of quitting smoking. Despite the assumptions on how self-efficacy is built formulated by Bandura two decades ago, there is only little empirical evidence on the origins of self-efficacy. The open research questions for these two studies were whether mastery experiences (experiencing success with the new behavior) and vicarious experiences (seeing others succeed) facilitate the smoking cessation process, whether mastery experiences and self-efficacy affect one another reciprocally and whether intimate partners serve as role models for each other. What does this study add? Mastery experiences and self-efficacy are mutually depended on a day-to-day basis within the smoking cessation process. Effects of mastery experiences fade rapidly, indicating that constant successes are needed to keep up self-efficacy. Dual-smoker couples show similar changes in a contagious way - if mastery experiences increase in one person, mastery experiences increase in the partner; if self-efficacy increases in one person, self-efficacy increases in the partner, too. No support for vicarious experiences (mastery experiences in one person affecting self-efficacy in the partner and vice versa) as sources of self-efficacy in the quitting process was found.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/157090","SDG":0}

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:164854","TITLE":"Character Strengths and PERMA: Investigating the Relationships of Character Strengths with a Multidimensional Framework of Well-Being","ABSTRACT":"Character strengths are positively valued traits that are expected to contribute to the good life (Peterson and Seligman 2004). Numerous studies have confirmed their robust relationships with subjective or hedonic well-being. Seligman (2011) provided a new framework of well-being suggesting five dimensions that encompass both hedonic and eudemonic aspects of well-being: positive emotions, engagement, positive relationships, meaning and accomplishment (forming the acronym PERMA). However, the role of character strengths has not been studied so far in this framework. Also, most studies on the relationships between character strengths and well-being only have only relied on self-reports. This set of two studies examines the relationships of character strengths and the orientations to well-being in two cross-sectional studies (Study 1: N\u2009=\u20095521), while also taking informant-reports into account and utilizing different questionnaires to control for a possible method bias (Study 2: N\u2009=\u2009172). Participants completed validated assessments of character strengths and the PERMA dimensions (self-reports in Study 1, self- and informant-reports in Study 2). Results showed that in self-reports, all strengths were positively related to all PERMA dimensions, but there were differences in the size of the relationships. Accomplishment, for example, showed the strongest associations with strengths such as perspective, persistence, and zest, whereas for positive relationships, strengths such as teamwork, love, and kindness were the best predictors. These findings were largely confirmed by informant-reports in Study 2. The findings provide further support for the notion that character contributes to well-being and they could guide the development of strengths-based interventions tailored to individual needs.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/164854","SDG":0}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:157088","TITLE":"A cluster randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of an individual planning intervention with collaborative planning in adolescent friendship dyads to enhance physical activity (TWOgether)","ABSTRACT":"BACKGROUND: Most adolescents do not meet the recommendations for physical activity (PA) of at least 1 h per day. Individual planning (IP) interventions, including forming plans for when, where and how (action planning) to engage in a behavior, as well as the planning for how to deal with arising barriers (coping planning), are effective to enhance PA in adults. Collaborative planning (CP) is conjoint planning of two individuals regarding a behavior which is performed together. It is assumed that CP stimulates social exchange processes between the planning partners. However, it remains unclear whether planning interventions of PA in adolescents are successful and which planning intervention is more effective. Thus, this cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) examines changes in daily moderate-to-vigorous PA in adolescents' friendship dyads resulting from planning. Individual self-regulating mechanism and social exchange processes are proposed as mediating mechanisms of the effects of planning for health behavior change.\r\n\r\nMETHODS: A single-blind four-arm parallel-group cluster-RCT is used. The sample consists of 400 friendship dyads between 14 and 18\u00a0years of age. As the recruitment takes place in schools, a cluster randomization of the schools is used to enroll dyads to (a) an IP intervention, (b) a CP intervention or (c) one of the two no-planning control conditions. Devise-measured and self-reported PA as the primary outcomes, self-regulatory strategies, and social exchange processes as secondary outcomes are assessed at three or four time points. After baseline measurement, the baseline ecological momentary assessment of the main variables takes place for 8\u00a0days followed by the intervention and a 7-days diary phase. Follow-ups are 1 month and 6 months later. Subsequent to the six-month follow-up, another 7-days diary phase takes place.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION: This is the first study examining IP in comparison to CP in adolescents applying a single-blind cluster RCT. Consequently, the study allows for understanding the efficacy of individual and collaborative planning and the underlying mechanisms in adolescent dyads.\r\n\r\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: This RCT was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (100019_169781\/1) and was registered on 18\/06\/2018 at ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT03575559 .","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/157088","SDG":0}

The gastric microbe Helicobacter pylori represents an ancestral constituent of the human microbiota that causes gastric disorders on the one hand and is inversely associated with allergies and chronic inflammatory conditions on the other.  OBJECTIVE  Here we investigate the consequences of transmaternal exposure to H pylori in utero and\/or during lactation for susceptibility to viral and bacterial infection, predisposition to allergic airway inflammation, and development of immune cell populations in the lungs and lymphoid organs.  METHODS  We use experimental models of house dust mite- or ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation and influenza A virus or Citrobacter rodentium infection along with metagenomics analyses, multicolor flow cytometry, and bisulfite pyrosequencing, to study the effects of H pylori on allergy severity and immunologic and microbiome correlates thereof.  RESULTS  Perinatal exposure to H pylori extract or its immunomodulator vacuolating cytotoxin confers robust protective effects against allergic airway inflammation not only in first- but also second-generation offspring but does not increase susceptibility to viral or bacterial infection. Immune correlates of allergy protection include skewing of regulatory over effector T cells, expansion of regulatory T-cell subsets expressing CXCR3 or retinoic acid-related orphan receptor \u03b3t, and demethylation of the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) locus. The composition and diversity of the gastrointestinal microbiota is measurably affected by perinatal H pylori exposure.  CONCLUSION  We conclude that exposure to H pylori has consequences not only for the carrier but also for subsequent generations that can be exploited for interventional purposes.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/157671","SDG":0}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:124568","TITLE":"Microbes and asthma: Opportunities for intervention","ABSTRACT":"The worldwide incidence and prevalence of asthma continues to increase. Asthma is now understood as an umbrella term for different phenotypes or endotypes, which arise through different pathophysiologic pathways. Understanding the many factors contributing to development of the disease is important for the identification of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of certain asthma phenotypes. The hygiene hypothesis has been formulated to explain the increasing prevalence of allergic disease, including asthma. This hypothesis postulates that decreased exposure at a young age to certain infectious agents as a result of improved hygiene, increased antibiotic use and vaccination, and changes in lifestyle and dietary habits is associated with changes in the immune system, which predispose subjects to allergy. Many microbes, during their coevolution with human subjects, developed mechanisms to manipulate the human immune system and to increase their chances of survival. Improving models of asthma, as well as choosing adequate end points in clinical trials, will lead to a more complete understanding of the underlying mechanisms, thus providing an opportunity to devise primary and secondary interventions at the same time as identifying new molecular targets for treatment. This article reports the discussion and conclusion of a workshop under the auspices of the Netherlands Lung Foundation to extend our understanding of how modulation of the immune system by bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections might affect the development of asthma and to map out future lines of investigation.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/124568","SDG":0}

Here we report that human myxovirus resistance protein B (MxB, also designated Mx2) is a potent human herpesvirus restriction factor in the context of IFN. We demonstrate that ectopic MxB expression restricts a range of herpesviruses from the Alphaherpesvirinae and Gammaherpesvirinae, including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). MxB restriction of HSV-1 and HSV-2 requires GTPase function, in contrast to restriction of lentiviruses. MxB inhibits the delivery of incoming HSV-1 DNA to the nucleus and the appearance of empty capsids, but not the capsid delivery to the cytoplasm or tegument dissociation from the capsid. Our study identifies MxB as a potent pan-herpesvirus restriction factor which blocks the uncoating of viral DNA from the incoming viral capsid.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/151624","SDG":0}

Despite great advances in the field, it remains unclear to which extent the composition of the gut microbiota is modulated by the intake of animal derived products, compared to a vegetable based diet. Here the specific impact of vegan, vegetarian, and omnivore feeding type on the composition of gut microbiota of 101 adults was investigated among groups homogeneous for variables known to have a role in modulating gut microbial composition such as age, anthropometric variables, ethnicity, and geographic area. The results displayed a picture where the three different dietetic profiles could be well distinguished on the basis of participant\u2019s dietetic regimen. Regarding the gut microbiota; vegetarians had a significantly greater richness compared to omnivorous. Moreover, counts of Bacteroidetes related operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were greater in vegans and vegetarians compared to omnivores. Interestingly considering the whole bacterial community composition the three cohorts were unexpectedly similar, which is probably due to their common intake in terms of nutrients rather than food, e.g., high fat content and reduced protein and carbohydrate intake. This finding suggests that fundamental nutritional choices such as vegan, vegetarian, or omnivore do influence the microbiota but do not allow to infer conclusions on gut microbial composition, and suggested the possibility for a preferential impact of other variables, probably related to the general life style on shaping human gut microbial community in spite of dietary influence. Consequently, research were individuals are categorized on the basis of their claimed feeding types is of limited use for scientific studies, since it appears to be oversimplified.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/163387","SDG":0}

Here, using quantitative phosphoproteomics, we reveal the unique phosphoproteome dynamics that occur in the host cell within minutes of influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We uncover cellular kinases required for the observed signaling pattern and find that inhibition of selected candidates, such as the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), leads to decreased IAV replication. As GRK2 has emerged as drug target in heart disease, we focus on its role in IAV infection and show that it is required for viral uncoating. Replication of seasonal and pandemic IAVs is severely decreased by specific GRK2 inhibitors in primary human airway cultures and in mice. Our study reveals the IAV-induced changes to the cellular phosphoproteome and identifies GRK2 as crucial node of the kinase network that enables IAV replication.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/162415","SDG":3}

We used sensor (GPS and accelerometer) and self-reported data from 27 healthy older adults (\u226567 years) who participated in the MOASIS project over a 30-day period. Based on sensor data we computed three commonly used daily mobility indicators: life space (LS), travel duration using passive (i.e., motorized) modes of transportation (pMOT) and travel duration using active (i.e., non-motorized) modes of transportation (aMOT). We assessed the degree to which these sensor-derived indicators compare to corresponding self-reports at a within-person level, computing intraindividual correlations (iCorrs), subsequently assessing whether iCorrs can be associated with participants\u2019 socio-demographic characteristics on a between-person level. Moderate to large positive mean iCorrs between the respective self-reported and sensor-derived indicators were found (r = 0.75 for LS, 0.51 for pMOT and 0.36 for aMOT). In comparison to sensor-derived indicators, self-reported LS slightly underestimates, while self-reported aMOT as well as pMOT considerably overestimate the amount of daily mobility. Participants with access to a car have higher probabilities of agreement in the pMOT indicator. Sensor-based assessments are promising as they are \u201cobjective\u201d, involve less participant burden and observations can be extended over long periods. The findings of this paper help researchers on mobility and aging to estimate the magnitude and direction of potential differences in the assessed variable due to the assessment methods.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/160701","SDG":0}

Most sensor-based studies are focused on measuring the level (or intensity) of physical activity and use data collected using a specific study protocol under a controlled laboratory condition and are thus hardly comparable to each other and difficult to use as training or validation data for real-life studies. Therefore, it is important to have available a reference dataset for physical activity type classification especially in real-life environments. The main aim of this study is to provide a study design for collecting a reference dataset that can maximize both internal and ecological validity of measuring physical activity types. To that end, we designed study protocols in three different conditions, namely: laboratory\/controlled, semi-structured and real life. To collect data, a sample of 40 healthy participants (30 younger adults and 10 older adults) will participate to perform activities including: lying, sitting, standing, walking on level ground, running, cycling, walking uphill, walking downhill, walking downstairs and walking upstairs both indoors and outdoors. The activity walking on level ground will be performed at three different speeds. Additionally, GPS and GIS methods (e.g. information about slope or dominant land use) will be used to enrich the detailed information about accelerometry-based activity types and to provide the environmental information of the place where the activities will take place. The proposed reference dataset can be useful for future validation and comparison studies and for the development of new physical activity type classifications algorithms particularly under real-life conditions.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/161051","SDG":0}

Evidence exists on the investments, interventions and enabling policies required. Less is understood about why some countries achieve faster progress than other comparable countries. The Success Factors for Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Health studies sought to address this knowledge gap using statistical and econometric analyses of data from 144 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) over 20 years; Boolean, qualitative comparative analysis; a literature review; and country-specific reviews in 10 fast-track countries for MDGs 4 and 5a. There is no standard formula \u2013 fast-track countries deploy tailored strategies and adapt quickly to change. However, fast-track countries share some effective approaches in addressing three main areas to reduce maternal and child mortality. First, these countries engage multiple sectors to address crucial health determinants. Around half the reduction in child mortality in LMICs since 1990 is the result of health sector investments, the other half is attributed to investments made in sectors outside health. Second, these countries use strategies to mobilize partners across society, using timely, robust evidence for decision-making and accountability and a triple planning approach to consider immediate needs, long-term vision and adaptation to change. Third, the countries establish guiding principles that orient progress, align stakeholder action and achieve results over time. This evidence synthesis contributes to global learning on accelerating improvements in women\u2019s and children\u2019s health towards 2015 and beyond.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/101669","SDG":3}

Although neglect is the most frequent form of maltreatment, it has thus far only received little attention, especially when looking at low-resource countries. The current study investigated possible associations between neglect and internalizing and externalizing problems. As neglect and abuse often co-occur, the latter was controlled for. In total, 409 Tanzanian primary school students (52% boys, M = 10.5 years, range = 6-15) participated in the cross-sectional study. Structured clinical interviews were conducted assessing maltreatment, internalizing problems, and externalizing problems. Overall, 31% (n = 128) of the children reported at least one type of physical neglect and 31% (n = 127) of emotional neglect. Using structural equation modeling, we found a significant association between neglect and internalizing (\u03b2 = 0.59, p < .01) and externalizing problems (\u03b2 = 0.35, p < .05). However, these associations could only be detected in younger children (ages 6-9), whereas in older children (ages 10-15), mental health problems were significantly related to violence and abuse. Our findings suggest that the current age may influence the association between maltreatment type and the development of internalizing and\/or externalizing problems.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/150739","SDG":16}

In the interpersonal trauma sample, being female positively predicted child depression. Furthermore, parental dysfunctional PTCs positively predicted both child PTSS and depression. No mediation effect of child dysfunctional PTCs was found in the interpersonal trauma sample.

We were interested in studying several transitions that are specific for older people: aging, retirement, living alone, and being widowed. We examined the relationships of these demographic characteristics and living conditions with character strengths and studied their effects on the association of character strengths with life satisfaction. In a cross-sectional analysis, 15,598 older adults (aged 46\u201393 years) who had completed measures on character strengths, life satisfaction, and demographic characteristics and living conditions were selected from an existing database. Overall, analyses revealed positive associations of most character strengths with age, and higher scores in most character strengths for the employed (vs. the retired) and those living with a partner (vs. those living alone), while only few relationships with being widowed (vs. being married) were observed. Further, the contribution of character strengths to life satisfaction generally decreased slightly with age, but increased for certain character strengths, such as modesty or prudence. Also, stronger relationships between several character strengths and life satisfaction were found for retired people and those living alone, while being widowed did not affect these relationships. The results demonstrate how character strengths might contribute to the life satisfaction of older adults in various living conditions and thereby offer a starting point for strengths-based programs in later life.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/164864","SDG":0}

Thus far, studies have investigated the International Classification of Diseases (11th rev.; ICD-11) criteria for PTSD only in samples of children older than 6 years of age. The aim of this study was to test the diagnostic agreement between the ICD-11 and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5) criteria for children who are 6 years old and younger. Caregivers of children aged 3-6 years in foster care in Germany (N\u00a0=\u00a0147) and parents of children aged 1-4 years who had attended a hospital in Switzerland following burn injuries (N \u00a0=\u00a0149) completed a questionnaire about children's PTSD. Rates of PTSD were calculated according to ICD-11 (considering a specific and a more general conceptualization of intrusive memories) and DSM-5 criteria and were compared using McNemar's tests and Cohen's kappa. The proportion of children who met the ICD-11 criteria was 0.6-25.8% lower than the proportion of PTSD cases according to the DSM-5 criteria. The diagnostic agreement between each ICD-11 algorithm and DSM-5 was moderate, \u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.52-0.66. A systematic investigation of adaptions of the ICD-11 avoidance cluster identified alternative symptom combinations leading to higher agreement with the DSM-5 requirements. Furthermore, DSM-5 had higher predictive power for functional impairment than the ICD-11 algorithms. In conclusion, the findings suggest that the ICD-11 criteria show less sensitivity in very young children, which can be explained by the more stringent avoidance cluster.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/157050","SDG":0}

In contrast, preliminary evidence suggests that the ICD-11 criteria might not appropriately capture PTSD in young children. The inclusion of PTSD<6Y, the first developmental subtype in the DSM-5, represents an important step towards having a diagnostic system that is developmentally sensitive and relevant across the life span. However, further validation work and research with regard to the definition of trauma and functional impairment as well as with the age-appropriate description of symptoms is needed, especially in the youngest age group (0-3\u00a0years).","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/157048","SDG":0}

However, little is known about the subjective coping success and development of positively evaluated resources that may originate within these adverse experiences and may be conceptualized as thriving. This study set out to examine the relationship between thriving in response to early adversity and successful aging with a sample of former indentured child laborers in Switzerland (Verdingkinder).\r\n\r\nMETHODS: Participants were screened according to subjective and objective health-related attributes, and those who were evaluated to be \"successful agers\" were included. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 12 former Verdingkinder (mean age: 71 years) that lasted 60-120 minutes. The interviews were analyzed using the paradigm model of the Grounded Theory.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: In the interviews adverse experiences and negative consequences were reported. However, where thriving was triggered in response to these experiences, the factors identified as \"lightheartedness,\" \"social purpose,\" and \"self-enhancement\" were associated with successful aging. Factors including motivation, reflection, personality traits, social support, individual coping strategies, turning points, and processing were reported as central to thriving.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: The identified factors show similarities with established predictors of health and well-being. Thus, under certain circumstances early and prolonged adverse experiences can also provide the opportunity to develop positive resources for successful aging.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/153540","SDG":16}

However, it is known that across different cultures, a broad range of metaphorical idioms for describing adaptive responses to severe adversity exists. This study aimed to explore and contrast two distinct cultural groups\u2019 culturally shared metaphors for overcoming severe adversities. Fieldwork was conducted in two rural communities: an indigenous Brazilian community that has experienced severe collective adversity and a mountain village in Switzerland that has survived a natural disaster. We carried out separate qualitative metaphor analyses of semistructured interview data from each community. There were some similarities in the metaphorical narratives of the two cultural groups, for example, in metaphors of balance, changed perspective, collective cohesion and life as a journey. The main variations were found in metaphors of magical thinking, equilibrium and organic transformation used by the Brazilian group and metaphors of work, order and material transformation used by the Swiss group. Results from this study suggest that the Western-devised concepts of resilience and PTG can be further expanded, which is highlighted by the variety of culturally shared metaphors. Metaphorical idioms for overcoming severe adversity may be determined by the type of trauma as well as by the sociocultural and historical context. Our findings indicate potential approaches to the cultural adaptation of psychological interventions.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/152232","SDG":0}

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:135113","TITLE":"The risk of female genital cutting in Europe: Comparing immigrant attitudes toward uncut girls with attitudes in a practicing country","ABSTRACT":"Worldwide, an estimated 200 million girls and women have been subjected to female genital cutting. Female genital cutting is defined as an intentional injury to the female genitalia without medical justification. The practice occurs in at least 29 countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. In addition, globalization and migration have brought immigrants from countries where cutting is commonly practiced to countries where cutting is not traditionally practiced and may even be illegal. In countries receiving immigrants, governments and development agencies would like to know if girls with parents who immigrated from practicing countries are at risk of being cut. Risk assessments, for example, could help governments identify the need for programs promoting the abandonment of cutting among immigrants. Extrapolating from the prevalence and incidence rates in practicing countries, however, is generally not sufficient to guarantee a valid estimate of risk in immigrant populations. In particular, immigrants might differ from their counterparts in the country of origin in terms of attitudes toward female genital cutting. Attitudes can differ because migrants represent a special sample of people from the country of origin or because immigrants acculturate after arriving in a new country. To examine these possibilities, we used a fully anonymous, computerized task to elicit implicit attitudes toward female genital cutting among Sudanese immigrants living in Switzerland and Sudanese people in Sudan. Results show that Sudanese immigrants in Switzerland were significantly more positive about uncut girls than Sudanese in Sudan, and that selective migration out of Sudan likely contributed substantially to this difference. We conclude by suggesting how our method could potentially be coupled with recent efforts to refine extrapolation methods for estimating cutting risk among immigrant populations. More broadly, our results highlight the need to better understand how heterogeneous attitudes can affect the risk of cutting among immigrant communities and in countries of origin.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/135113","SDG":5}

We then show that randomly correcting these beliefs about others increases married men\u2019s willingness to let their wives join the labor force (as measured by their costly sign-up for a job-matching service for their wives). Finally, we find that this decision maps onto real outcomes: four months after the main intervention, the wives of men in our original sample whose beliefs about acceptability of FLFP were corrected are more likely to have applied and interviewed for a job outside of home. Together, our evidence indicates a potentially important source of labor market frictions, where job search is underprovided due to misperceived social norms.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/168820","SDG":5}

Many studies also document gender differences in a variety of important preference dimensions, such as risk-taking, competition and pro-sociality. However, the degree to which differential voting by men and women is related to these gaps in more basic preferences requires an improved understanding. We conduct an experiment in which individuals in small laboratory \u201csocieties\u201d repeatedly vote for redistribution policies and engage in production. We find that women vote for more egalitarian redistribution and that this difference persists with experience and in environments with varying degrees of risk. This gender voting gap is accounted for partly by both gender gaps in preferences and by\r\nexpectations regarding economic circumstances. However, including both these controls in a regression analysis indicates that the latter is the primary driving force. We also observe policy differences between male- and female-controlled groups, though these are substantially smaller than the mean individual differences - a natural consequence of the aggregation of individual.\r\npreferences into collective outcomes.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/142000","SDG":0}

Since 1980, conditional on being a college-educated man, the probability of working in a cognitive\/high-wage occupation has fallen. This contrasts starkly with the experience for college-educated women: their probability of working in these occupations rose, despite a much larger increase in the supply of educated women relative to men. We show that one key channel capable of rationalizing these findings is a greater increase in the demand for female-oriented skills in cognitive\/high-wage occupations relative to other occupations. Using occupation-level data, we find evidence that this relative increase in the demand for female skills is due to an increasing importance of social skills within such occupations. Evidence from both male and female wages is also indicative of an increase in the demand for social skills.

We link parental education and family structure during childhood to male\u2013female and brother\u2013sister differences in adolescent outcomes, educational attainment, and adult earnings and employment. Our results are consistent with U.S. findings that boys benefit more from an advantageous family environment than do girls in terms of grade-school outcomes. Father\u2019s education, which has not been examined in previous studies, is particularly important for sons. However, we find a very different pattern of parental influence on adult outcomes. Gender gaps in educational attainment, employment, and earnings are increasing in maternal education, benefiting daughters. Paternal education decreases the gender gaps in educational attainment (favoring sons) and labor market outcomes (favoring daughters). We conclude that differences in the behavior of school-aged boys and girls may be poor proxies for differences in skills that drive longer-term outcomes.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/161018","SDG":5}

When employees are evaluated differently because of who they are rather than how they perform, an ethical dilemma arises for leaders and organizations. Thus, bridging role congruity and social identity leadership theories, we propose that gender biases in leadership evaluations can be overcome by manipulating diversity at the team level. Across two multiple-source, multiple-wave, and randomized field experiments, we test whether team gender composition restores gender equity in leadership evaluations. In Study 1, we find that male leaders are rated as more prototypical in male-dominated groups, an advantage that is eliminated in gender-balanced groups. In Study 2, we replicate and extend this finding by showing that leader gender and team gender composition interact to predict trust in the leader via perceptions of leader prototypicality. The results show causal support for the social identity model of organizational leadership and a boundary condition of role congruity theory. Beyond moral arguments of fairness, our findings also show how, in the case of gender, team diversity can create a more level playing field for leaders. Finally, we outline the implications of our results for leaders, organizations, business ethics, and society.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/150948","SDG":5}

Women \u2013 spouses and daughters \u2013 provide most of this care work. In principle, gender inequality in intergenerational care may have three causes: first, daughters and sons have different resources to provide care; second, daughters and sons respond differently to the same resources; third, welfare state programmes and cultural norms affect daughters and sons differently. In this paper, we address the empirical question whether these three assumed causes are in fact responsible for gender differences in intergenerational care. The empirical analyses, based on the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), reveal that parents in need are in fact more likely to receive care from daughters than from sons. Daughters are more responsive to the needs of their parents than sons and respond differently to the same resources. Gender inequality is highest in countries with a high level of intergenerational care, high public spending on old-age cash-benefits, a low provision of professional care services, high family obligation norms and a high level of gendered division of labour. Welfare state programmes reduce or increase gender inequality in intergenerational care by reducing or increasing the engagement of daughters in intergenerational care. In general, care-giving by sons is hardly influenced by social care policies.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/85506","SDG":5}

The analysis relies on an original data set of over 1,500 municipal elections in Switzerland, starting with the first election after the introduction of women's suffrage. In the first election in which women could participate, the election of a woman in a given municipality was associated in the next election with an additional female candidate in 10% of its neighbors. The relationship decreases over time, fades away after 16 years, and is driven primarily by new female candidates in units where no female incumbents are running for reelection. These findings suggest that role models are important for improving women's representation, but only in its early stages.

Explaining the underrepresentation of women in online political news","ABSTRACT":"In previous decades, women in Western countries have gained more influence in various social realms. The percentage of females in higher education, the workforce, boards at publicly traded companies and national parliaments has increased. However, substantial underrepresentation of women in political news has remained. To explain the reasons behind this gender imbalance in news content, we conducted a content analysis of different types of online news in six Western countries. In our study, we distinguish among three levels of analysis: (1) the story level (frequency and format), (2) the media organization level (popular vs mass and upmarket outlets) and (3) the societal level. The results indicate that female actors are most frequently covered by popular news outlets and are more likely to be depicted in a photograph. Furthermore, strong determinants of continued gender differences in political news were found at the country level. Specifically, coverage increases in countries where gender equality is progressing in major parts of society.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/138940","SDG":0}

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:167403","TITLE":"Priming of microbial microcystin degradation in biomass-fed gravity driven membrane filtration biofilms","ABSTRACT":"Gravity-driven membrane (GDM) filtration is a promising tool for low-cost decentralized drinking water production. The biofilms in GDM systems are able of removing harmful chemical components, particularly toxic cyanobacterial metabolites such as microcystins (MCs). This is relevant for the application of GDM filtration because anthropogenic nutrient input and climate change have led to an increase of toxic cyanobacterial blooms. However, removal of MCs in newly developing GDM biofilms is only established after a prolonged period of time. Since cyanobacterial blooms are transient phenomena, it is important to understand MC removal in mature biofilms with or without prior toxin exposure. In this study, the microbial community composition of GDM biofilms was investigated in systems fed with water from a lake with periodic blooms of MC-producing cyanobacteria. Two out of three experimental treatments were supplemented with dead biomass of a MC-containing cyanobacterial strain, or of a non-toxic mutant, respectively. Analysis of bacterial rRNA genes revealed that both biomass-amended treatments were significantly more similar to each other than to a non-supplemented control. Therefore, it was hypothesized that biofilms could potentially be 'primed' for rapid MC removal by prior addition of non-toxic biomass. A subsequent experiment showed that MC removal developed significantly faster in mature biofilms that were pre-fed with biomass from the mutant strain than in unamended controls, indicating that MC degradation was a facultative trait of bacterial populations in GDM biofilms. The significant enrichment of bacteria related to both aerobic and anaerobic MC degraders suggested that this process might have occurred in parallel in different microniches.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/167403","SDG":6}

As an efficient wetting of the filter material is crucial for water treatment, the wettability of SNFs is readily modified from superhydrophobic to hydrophilic during the functionalization process. SNFs are coated on glass beads and subsequently modified with biocidal silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The enlarged surface area of SNFs allows a 30 times higher loading of AgNPs in comparison to glass beads without SNF coating. Thus, in column experiments, the AgNP-SNF-nanocomposite-modified glass beads exert superior antibacterial activity towards suspensions of E. coli K12 compared to AgNP functionalized glass beads without SNFs. Additionally, reusing the AgNP-SNF-nanocomposite-coated glass beads with fresh bacteria contaminated medium increases their efficacy and reduces the colony forming units by \u22486 log units. Thereby, the silver loss during percolation is below 0.1 \u03bcg mL\u22121. These results highlight, first, the potential of AgNP-SNF-nanocomposite-modified glass beads as an effective filter substrate for water disinfection, and second, the efficiency of SNF coating in increasing the contact area of conventional filter material.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/131354","SDG":6}

Consequently, snow storage is expected to decrease, which, together with changes in snowmelt rates and timing, might cause reductions in spring and summer low flows. The objectives of this study were (1) to simulate the effect of changing snow storage on low flows during the warm seasons and (2) to relate drought sensitivity to the simulated snow storage changes at different elevations. The Swiss Climate Change Scenarios 2011 data set was used to derive future changes in air temperature and precipitation. A typical bucket\u2010type catchment model, HBV\u2010light, was applied to 14 mountain catchments in Switzerland to simulate streamflow and snow in the reference period and three future periods. The largest relative decrease in annual maximum SWE was simulated for elevations below 2,200 m a.s.l. (60\u201375% for the period 2070\u20132099) and the snowmelt season shifted by up to 4 weeks earlier. The relative decrease in spring and summer minimum runoff that was caused by the relative decrease in maximum SWE (i.e., elasticity), reached 40\u201390% in most of catchments for the reference period and decreased for the future periods. This decreasing elasticity indicated that the effect of snow on summer low flows is reduced in the future. The fraction of snowmelt runoff in summer decreased by more than 50% at the highest elevations and almost disappeared at the lowest elevations. This might have large implications on water availability during the summer.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/160115","SDG":0}

However, applications in an aqueous environment pose a serious challenge to anchoring groups in terms of stability. Ultrathin overlayers embedding these catalysts on the surface using atomic layer deposition (ALD) are an elegant solution to tackle the anchoring group instability. The propensity of ALD precursors to react with water leads to the question whether molecules containing aqua ligands, such as most water oxidation complexes, can be protected without side reactions and deactivation during the deposition process. We synthesized two iridium and two ruthenium-based water oxidation catalysts, which contained an aqua ligand (Ir\u2013OH2 and Ru\u2013OH2) or a chloride (Ir\u2013Cl and Ru\u2013Cl) that served as a protecting group for the former. Using a ligand exchange reaction on the anchored and partially embedded Ru\u2013Cl, the optimal overlayer thickness was determined to be 1.6 nm. An electrochemical test of the protected catalysts on meso-ITO showed different behaviors for the Ru and the Ir catalysts. The former showed no onset difference between protected and non-protected versions, but limited stability. Ir\u2013Cl displayed excellent stability, whilst the unprotected catalyst Ir\u2013OH2 showed a later initial onset. Self-regeneration of the catalytic activity of Ir\u2013OH2 under operating conditions was observed. We propose chloride ligands as generally applicable protecting groups for catalysts that are to be stabilized on surfaces using ALD.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/167538","SDG":7}

Previous studies with Cu2O for water splitting usually deliver high photocurrent or high photovoltage, but not both. Here, a Cu2O\/Ga2O3\/TiO2\/RuOx photocathode that benefits from a high quality thermally oxidized Cu2O layer and good band alignment of the Ga2O3 buffer layer is reported, yielding a photocurrent of 6 mA cm\u22122 at 0 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), an onset potential of 0.9 V versus RHE, and 3.5 mA cm\u22122 at 0.5 V versus RHE. The quantum efficiency spectrum (incident photon to current efficiency, IPCE) reveals a dramatically improved green\/red response and a decreased blue response compared with electrodeposited Cu2O films. Light intensity dependence and photocurrent transient studies enable the identification of the limitations in the performance. Due to the complementary IPCE curves of thermally oxidized and electrodeposited Cu2O photocathodes, a dual photocathode is fabricated to maximize the absorption over the entire range of above band gap radiation. Photocurrents of 7 mA cm\u22122 at 0 V versus RHE are obtained in the dual photocathodes, with an onset potential of 0.9 V versus RHE and a thermodynamically based energy conversion efficiency of 1.9%.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/146991","SDG":7}

To lower the burden on the end-users, our goal is the design of a smart thermostat that automatically heats the home, optimally trading o the user\u2019s comfort and cost. This is a challenging problem due to two sources of uncertainty: future weather conditions and future electricity prices. Our main technical contribution is a general technique that uses predictive distributions obtained from Gaussian Process (GP) regressions to compute the state transition probabilities of an MDP, such that the solution to the resulting MDP constitutes a sequentially optimal policy. We apply this general approach to the home-heating problem, where we use the predictive distributions of the GPs for the day-ahead external temperatures and electricity prices. The solution to the home-heating MDP constitutes an optimal heating policy that maximizes the user\u2019s utility given the probability information gathered by the Gaussian process model.

Both complexes undergo a series of substitution reactions at oxidation state RuII and RuIII when dissolved in aqueous triflic acid\u2013trifluoroethanol solutions as monitored by UV\/Vis spectroscopy, and the corresponding rate constants were determined. In particular, aqueous solutions of the RuIII-Cl complex trans-[RuIII(Cl)(L-OMe-\u03ba-N5)]2+ (trans-12+) generates a family of Ru aquo complexes, namely trans-[RuIII(H2O)(L-OMe-\u03ba-N5)]3+ (trans-23+), [RuIII(H2O)2(L-OMe-\u03ba-N4)]3+ (trans-33+), and [RuIII(Cl)(H2O)(L-OMe-\u03ba-N4)]2+ (trans-42+).

These tools efficiently compare and provide a global evaluation of catalyst performance while highlighting the limitations for a given reaction. In the framework of solid-state water oxidation, a minimal overpotential of 0.4 eV has been predicted on the basis of LFESRs. Considering the very different nature of homogeneous catalysts compared to solid-state systems, the validity of scaling relationships determined for the former cannot be assumed. To evaluate the global limitations of molecular O-2 evolution catalysts, LFESRs are established for all key intermediates for different metal (Mn, Co, Ru, Rh, Ir) and ligand (corrole and perfluoro-porphyrin) combinations assuming a mononuclear mechanism that proceeds through *=OH, *=O, and *-OOH intermediates. Our computations indicate that the LFESRs strongly depend on the choice of density functional. Using GMC-QDPT2 as a benchmark, strong scaling relationships between all intermediates are observed, but the relationships between *-OH and *=O significantly differ from those found in solid-state systems. Consequently, the shape of the molecular volcano plot changes drastically from its solid-state counterpart and shows a broad plateau at the top where the overpotential is nearly independent of the choice of catalyst. This plateau renders the performance of molecular catalysts extremely robust, but inhibits improvements by proceeding through alternative reaction mechanisms.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/162384","SDG":7}

The main optimization parameter for ceria in solar reactors is the oxygen exchange capacity (OEC, Dd), which can be notably improved through various dopant types. Among them, tetravalent dopants excel through the formation of active vacancies which lead to particularly high OEC values. We thus performed a comprehensive screening evaluation of all dopants in the periodic table which have been reported to adopt an oxidation state of +IV. All thermally stable doped ceria samples, M0.1Ce0.9O2d (M \u00bc Si, Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Rh, Hf, Ta, Nb, V, Pr, and Tb), were first analyzed for Dd improvement with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Dopant solubility limits and behavior in the ceria host lattice was evaluated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDX) and powder X-ray diffraction techniques. No indications for carbonate side product formation were found. Hf-, Zr-, and Ta-doped ceria display higher OEC than pristine ceria, and Raman spectroscopy indicated that their improved performance is accompanied by a higher versatility in the underlying vacancy formation processes. Furthermore, the effective dopant radii are close to an optimal dopant radius around 0.8 \u00b0A for maximum Dd according to TGA cycling experiments. These experimentally derived trends for doped ceria were supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations which analogously correlate Dd with the partial electronic charge of the metal dopants.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/147140","SDG":7}

We find that the spillover effects are small for all countries in our sample, ranging from a cumulative real income loss of at most \u22120.2% to a cumulative real income gain of at most 0.2%.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/136051","SDG":8}

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:162794","TITLE":"Marginal jobs and job surplus: a test of the efficiency of separations","ABSTRACT":"We present a sharp test for the efficiency of job separations. First, we document a dramatic increase in the separation rate \u2013 11.2ppt (28%) over five years \u2013 in response to a quasi-experimental extension of UI benefit duration for older workers. Second, after the abolition of the policy, the \"job survivors\" in the formerly treated group exhibit exactly the same separation behavior as the control group. Juxtaposed, these facts reject the \"Coasean\" prediction of efficient separations, whereby the UI extensions should have extracted marginal (low-surplus) jobs and thereby rendered the remaining (high-surplus) jobs more resilient after its abolition. Third, we show that a formal model of predicted efficient separations implies a piece-wise linear function of the actual control group separations beyond the missing mass of marginal matches. A structural estimation reveals point estimates of the share of efficient separations below 4%, with confidence intervals rejecting shares above 13%. Fourth, to characterize the marginal jobs in the data, we extend complier analysis to difference-in-difference settings such as ours. The UI-indiced separators stemmed from declining firms, blue-collar jobs, with a high share of sick older workers, and firms more likely to have works councils \u2013 while their wages were similar to program survivors. The evidence is consistent with a \"non-Coasean\" framework building on wage frictions preventing efficient bargaining, and with formal or informal institutional constraints on selective separations.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/162794","SDG":8}

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:161598","TITLE":"Wages and the value of nonemployment","ABSTRACT":"Nonemployment is often posited as a worker\u2019s outside option in wage setting models such as bargaining and wage posting. The value of this state is therefore a fundamental determinant of wages and, in turn, labor supply and job creation. We measure the effect of changes in the value of nonemployment on wages in existing jobs and among job switchers. Our quasi-experimental variation in nonemployment values arises from four large reforms of unemployment insurance (UI) benefit levels in Austria. We document that wages are insensitive to UI benefit levels: point estimates imply a wage response of less than USD 0.01 per USD 1.00 UI benefit increase, and we can reject sensitivities larger than 0.03. In contrast, a calibrated Nash bargaining model predicts a sensitivity of 0.39 \u2013 more than ten times larger. The empirical insensitivity holds even among workers with a priori low bargaining power, with low labor force attachment, with high predicted unemployment duration, among job switchers and recently unemployed workers, in areas of high unemployment, in firms with flexible pay policies, and when considering firm-level bargaining. The insensitivity of wages to the nonemployment value we document presents a puzzle to widely used wage setting protocols, and implies that nonemployment may not constitute workers\u2019 relevant threat point. Our evidence supports wage-setting mechanisms that insulate wages from the value of nonemployment.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/161598","SDG":0}

The decline is primarily driven by changes in the propen- sity to work in routine jobs for individuals from a small set of demographic groups. These same groups account for a substantial fraction of both the increase in non-employment and employment in low-wage, non-routine manual occupations observed during the same period. We analyze a general neoclassical model of the labor market featuring endogenous participation and occupation choice. In response to an increase in automation technology, the framework embodies a tradeoffbetween reallocating employment across occupations and reallocation of workers towards non-employment. Quantitatively, we find that this standard model accounts for a relatively small portion of the joint decline in routine em- ployment and associated rise in non-routine manual employment and non-employment.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/145755","SDG":0}

With the increasing commercialisation and formalisation of transnational labour migration, recruitment agencies and agents have gained importance. The paper aims to contribute to a more differentiated understanding of the role and the practices of the main actors in the middle space of migration, the brokers in the recruitment process for transnational migration. Based on empirical material from Nepal, it argues that the detected negative reputation of labour brokers is only partially justified. Besides common bad practices and fraud cases, recruiters perform important roles for the facilitation of transnational mobility and present the necessary infrastructure for labour migration. They connect people and places, establish networks and can play an important role in making migration safer. Brokers are important facilitators in supporting alternative income strategies and new livelihood options of people. At the same time they are entrepreneurs in a competitive and risky economic field, confronted with multifaceted constraints. As long as the gap between the dreams of potential migrants and the reality of marginality in Nepal remains wide, labour brokers might persist as important middlemen for global work. Thus, migration brokerage is likely to remain big business.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/111984","SDG":8}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:111097","TITLE":"Sovereign debt sustainability in advanced economies","ABSTRACT":"We develop a measure of maximum sustainable government debt for advanced economies. How much investors are willing to lend to a country's government depends on how high a primary surplus they expect that government to generate, how fast they expect the country to grow, how volatile they expect that growth to be, and how much debt they expect the government will be able to raise in the future for the purpose of servicing the debt it seeks to raise today. This last observation points to the presence of a borrowing multiplier, which raises a country's borrowing well above what it would be, absent the ability to service maturing debt out of new debt's proceeds. Present debt is sustainable when implied future debt remains bounded. A country's probability of default displays a marked asymmetry around that country's maximum sustainable debt (MSD): it increases slowly below and rapidly above. We calibrate our measure for 23 OECD countries: Korea has the highest MSD at 281% of GDP and Greece the lowest at 89%. The probabilities of default at MSD are very low, from Norway's 0.27% to Korea's 0.81%. Most countries' actual debt-to-GDP ratios in 2010 are below MSD; some countries are above; these are generally the countries that have received some form of financial support in the wake of the financial crisis.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/111097","SDG":8}

A potential contributor to both phenomena is the declining labor-market opportunities faced by males, which make them less valuable as marital partners. We exploit large scale, plausibly exogenous labor-demand shocks stemming from rising international manufacturing competition to test how shifts in the supply of young \u2018marriageable\u2019 males affect marriage, fertility and children's living circumstances. Trade shocks to manufacturing industries have differentially negative impacts on the labor market prospects of men and degrade their marriage-market value along multiple dimensions: diminishing their relative earnings\u2014particularly at the lower segment of the distribution\u2014reducing their physical availability in trade-impacted labor markets, and increasing their participation in risky and damaging behaviors. As predicted by a simple model of marital decision-making under uncertainty, we document that adverse shocks to the supply of `marriageable' men reduce the prevalence of marriage and lower fertility but raise the fraction of children born to young and unwed mothers and living in in poor single-parent households. The falling marriage-market value of young men appears to be a quantitatively important contributor to the rising rate of out-of-wedlock childbearing and single-headed childrearing in the United States.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/138938","SDG":10}

Yet, by requiring that the premium be paid upfront, standard insurance products also transfer income across time. We show that this intertemporal transfer can help explain low insurance demand, especially among the poor, and in a randomized control trial in Kenya we test a crop insurance product which removes it. The product is interlinked with a contract farming scheme: as with other inputs, the buyer of the crop offers the insurance and deducts the premium from farmer revenues at harvest time. The take-up rate for pay-at-harvest insurance is 72 percent, compared to 5 percent for the standard pay-up-front contract, and the difference is largest among poorer farmers. Additional experiments and outcomes provide evidence on the role of liquidity constraints, present bias, and counterparty risk, and find that enabling farmers to commit to pay the premium just one month later increases demand by 21 percentage points.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/159985","SDG":8}

We introduce a model to compute the individual and systemic probability of default in a system of banks connected in a generic network of credit contracts and exposed to external shocks with a generic correlation structure. Even in the presence of complete knowledge, we identify conditions on the network for the emergence of multiple equilibria. Multiple equilibria give rise to uncertainty in the determination of the default probability. We show how this uncertainty can affect the estimation of systemic risk in terms of expected losses. We further quantify the effects of cyclicality, leverage, volatility and correlations. Our results are relevant to the current policy discussions on new regulatory framework to deal with systemic events of distress as well as on the desirable level of regulatory data disclosure.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/165439","SDG":8}

Our model is tractable enough to yield sharp analytic results, that complement and clarify an emerging empirical literature on labor market adjustment to trade. Existing generations that have accumulated specific human capital in one sector can switch sectors when the economy is hit by a trade shock. Nonetheless, the shock induces few workers to switch, generating a protracted adjustment that operates largely through the entry of new generations. This results in wages being tied to the sector of employment in the short-run but to the skill type in the long-run. Relative to a world with general human capital, welfare is improved for the skill group whose type-intensive sector shrinks. We extend the model to include physical capital and show that the transition is longer when capital is mobile. We also introduce nonpecuniary sector preferences and show that larger gross flows are associated with a longer transition.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/134159","SDG":8}

Starting from the observation that systematic theoretically driven empirical engagement with SIBs is still only in its infant stage, the paper has two aims: First, we seek to map the particular way in which SIBs emerged at the crossroads of state, (financial) market and philanthropy. Second, we question representations of the role of the state as absent, pointing to the disciplining force of calculative devices as a key means allowing government control \u201cat-adistance\u201d. The paper starts with a brief overview of SIBs as a social impact investing tool and a review of the existing scholarly debate on this phenomenon. The following three sections engage with dominant discursive representations that ambiguously position SIBs between \u201cstate\u201d, \u201cmarket\u201d and \u201cphilanthropy\u201d, thereby offering a malleable frame that allows interested actors to legitimize the implementation of this policy instrument. This is followed by a discussion of the material side of SIBs: the crucial role of various devices of measurement, evaluation and evidence-production in making SIBs possible. We conclude that it is with the help of these calculative devices that SIB-arrangements are realized, being illustrative of the vital role that the state continues to play in the social policy realm despite representations of weakness and absence.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/148708","SDG":8}

We structure our argument around what we perceive as key dimensions of marketization and their variegated geographies: First, we argue for renewed attention to the naturalization of abstract market knowledge and its methodological separation from real markets in the wake of the behavioral and experimental turn. We then turn to really existing markets, conceptualizing them as articulations of a variety of economic and social rationalities struggling over an apparent \u201cmoral market.\u201d Third, we focus on the role of the nonhuman in marketization processes and discuss the work of market devices in making these market arrangements possible. In the fourth and final section we turn to the \u201chuman side\u201d of marketization. Our argument is that market struggles connect with the formation of \u201cquasi-subjects\u201d that oscillate between attempts to reestablish autonomy and their dissolution in the disciplining webs of behavioral and experimental market devices.

Drawing on recent insights in economic geography, and in dialogue with the Latin American structuralist tradition, we elaborate our framework through a case study of the Argentinian soy boom of the 2000s, identifying forms of market extension, redistribution, reciprocity and householding that facilitated this process. We argue for a multi-scalar approach that balances attention to national and extra-local dynamics shaping the combination of these forms, identified through the lens of the \u201cfictitious commodities\u201d of the soy boom: money (credit, currency and cross-border capital flows), land (in the agricultural heartland and frontier regions), labor (transformed and excluded in a \u201cfarming without farmers\u201d model) and, we add, knowledge (biotech). Our analysis identifies internal tensions as well as overt resistance and \u201coverflow\u201d that ultimately led to the collapse of postneoliberal regulation of the soy complex, ushering in a wider, market radical counter-movement. Refracting double-movementtype dynamics through the prism of heterodox institutional forms, we argue, allows for a better grasp of processes that underlie institutional recalibrations of progressive and regressive kinds.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/162973","SDG":8}

Seventeen experts provided 42 propositions from ten different perspectives as input for the ERT. A full-day ERT deliberated communalities and relationships among these unseens  and provided suggestions on (i) what the major unseens  are; (ii) how rebound effects of digital transitioning may become the subject of overarching research; and (iii) what unseens should become subjects of transdisciplinary theory and practice processes for developing socially robust orientations. With respect to the latter, the experts suggested that the \u201cownership, economic value, use and access of data\u201d and, related to this, algorithmic decision-making call for transdisciplinary processes that may provide guidelines for key stakeholder groups on how the responsible use of digital data can be developed. A cluster-based content analysis of the propositions, the discussion and inputs of the ERT, and a theoretical analysis of major changes to levels of human systems and the human\u2013environment relationship resulted in the following greater picture: The digital transition calls for redefining economy, labor, democracy, and humanity. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based machines may take over major domains of human labor, reorganize supply chains, induce platform economics, and reshape the participation of economic actors in the value chain. (Digital) Knowledge and data supplement capital, labor, and natural resources as major economic variables. Digital data and technologies lead to a post-fuel industry (post-) capitalism. Traditional democratic processes can be (intentionally or unintentionally) altered by digital technologies. The unseens  in this field call for special attention, research and management. Related to the conditions of ontogenetic and phylogenetic development (humanity), the ubiquitous, global, increasingly AI-shaped interlinkage of almost every human personal, social, and economic activity and the exposure to indirect, digital, artificial, fragmented, electronically mediated data affect behavioral, cognitive, psycho-neuro-endocrinological processes on the level of the individual and thus social relations (of groups and families) and culture, and thereby, the essential quality and character of the human being (i.e., humanity).

Applying a novel internet-based matching algorithm to map all U.S. utility patents granted by 2013 to firm-level data, and carefully accounting for the shifting concentration of patenting activity across sectors, we document a robust, negative impact of rising Chinese competition on firm-level and technology class-level patent production. Accompanying this fall in innovation, global employment, sales, profitability, and R&D expenditure all decline within trade-exposed firms. The trade-induced contraction along all margins of adjustment and for all measures of valuation suggest that the primary response of firms to greater import competition is to scale back their global operations.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/144777","SDG":9}

In this paper we connect the two views and argue that tight business relationships can create dynamic inefficiencies and reduce broad innovations. In particular, we consider the repeated interaction between final good producers and intermediate input suppliers, where the provision of the intermediate input is noncontractible. We build a cooperative equilibrium where producers can switch suppliers and start cooperation immediately with new suppliers. We first consider broad innovations: every period, one supplier has the opportunity to create a higher quality input that can be used by all producers. Since relationships are harder to break in the cooperative equilibrium the market size for potential innovators is smaller and the rate of innovation might be lower than in the noncooperative equilibrium. We contrast this with a setting with relationship-specific innovations that we show are encouraged by the establishment of relational contracts. We illustrate the predictions of the model using the recent business history of the United States and Japan and further use patent data to show that U.S. patents are more general than Japanese and even more so in sectors using more differentiated inputs.

The unsettling question is whether the latest wave of innovation in online content personalisation technologies has shifted decision-making power from humans to computers. The paper argues that a thorough understanding of personalisation technologies is necessary to critically evaluate their normative effect and impact on social values. It reflects on the differences between regulation by code and regulation by law, exploring how code affects individual and social autonomies, and considering whether meta-rules regulating code are appropriate. The aim of this paper is to detail the constitutive features of the digital world and elucidate how these create norms that regulate the Internet.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/126429","SDG":16}

Many big data studies rely on traces of people\u2019s behavior on social media platforms such as opinions expressed through Twitter posts. How representative are such data? Whose voices are most likely to show up on such sites? Analyzing survey data about a national sample of American adults\u2019 social network site usage, this article examines what user characteristics are associated with the adoption of such sites. Findings suggest that several sociodemographic factors relate to who adopts such sites. Those of higher socioeconomic status are more likely to be on several platforms suggesting that big data derived from social media tend to oversample the views of more privileged people. Additionally, Internet skills are related to using such sites, again showing that opinions visible on these sites do not represent all types of people equally. The article cautions against relying on content from such sites as the sole basis of data to avoid disproportionately ignoring the perspectives of the less privileged. Whether business interests or policy considerations, it is important that decisions that concern the whole population are not based on the results of analyses that favor the opinions of those who are already better off.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/168010","SDG":10}

The theory of digital inequality suggests that even once people have gone online, differences among them will persist in important ways such as their online skills. We analyze survey data about older American adults\u2019 Internet skills to examine whether skills differ in this group and if they do, what explains differential online abilities. We find that there is considerable variation in Internet know-how and this relates to both socioeconomic status and autonomy of use. The results suggest that attempts to achieve a knowledgeable older adult population regarding Internet use must take into account these users\u2019 socioeconomic background and available access points.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/168039","SDG":10}

In this article, I review some of the pioneering studies that investigate how the emergence and penetration of modern communication technology across the world influences violent conflicts. Building on these important findings, I propose four entry points for future research. First, research on the link between the Internet and violent conflict needs to account for the profound changes the Internet has undergone in past decades, as well as the extent to which its nature is becoming increasingly endogenous to local contexts. Second, little is currently known about the effects of communication technology in violent conflict that move beyond initial mobilization. Third, architectural and algorithmic designs of social media platforms heavily influence the possibilities and constraints of human interactions on the Internet, but to date remain understudied. Fourth, further studies are needed to understand how the Internet has changed how violent conflict is communicated and portrayed both online and offline.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/144618","SDG":16}

With the help of sociological systems theory, this text argues that the social and legal institutionalisation of constitutional rights need to be distinguished. Commonly, constitutional rights emerge from society before they are reformulated in the legal realm. Using the example of the United States, the paper shows empirically that net neutrality is about to emerge as a new fundamental value and right. Its constitutionalisation is happening bottom-up, driven by social movements, Internet activists and advocacy groups, and further, in an interweavement of civil society dynamics with the legal system. The question is whether constitutional structures have already become identifiable. The last section discusses the relationship between social and formal constitutional structures from a legitimacy and democracy perspective.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/136370","SDG":9}

However, international comparisons of abstract, psychological constructs require the measurements to be equivalent\u2013i.e., they should measure the same concept on the same measurement scale. Traditional approaches to assessing measurement equivalence quite often\r\nlead to the conclusion that measurements are cross-nationally incomparable but have been criticized for being overly strict. In the current study, we present an alternative Bayesian approach that assesses whether measurements are approximately (rather than exactly)\r\nequivalent. This approach allows small variations in measurement parameters across groups.\r\nTaking a multiple group confirmatory factor analysis framework as a starting point, this study applies approximate and exact equivalence tests to the anti-immigration attitudes scale that was implemented in the European Social Survey (ESS). Measurement equivalence is tested across the full set of 271,220 individuals in 35 ESS countries over six rounds. The results of the exact and the approximate approaches are quite different. Approximate scalar measurement equivalence is established in all ESS rounds, thus allowing researchers to meaningfully compare these mean scores and their relationships with other theoretical constructs of interest. The exact approach, however, eventually proves to be overly strict and leads to the conclusion that measurements are incomparable for a large number of countries and time points.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/110767","SDG":10}

A one standard deviation increase in town-level program intensity leads to a 4.8% increase in local incumbent reelection rates. In addition, these political returns are higher in areas with lower tax evasion tolerance and with higher efficiency of public good provision, implying complementarity among enforcement policies, the underlying tax culture, and the quality of the government.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/127519","SDG":16}

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:127523","TITLE":"Changing cultural attitudes towards female genital cutting","ABSTRACT":"As globalization brings people with incompatible attitudes into contact, cultural conflicts inevitably arise. Little is known about how to mitigate conflict and about how the conflicts that occur can shape the cultural evolution of the groups involved. Female genital cutting is a prominent example1, 2, 3. Governments and international agencies have promoted the abandonment of cutting for decades, but the practice remains widespread with associated health risks for millions of girls and women4, 5. In their efforts to end cutting, international agents have often adopted the view that cutting is locally pervasive and entrenched1. This implies the need to introduce values and expectations from outside the local culture. Members of the target society may view such interventions as unwelcome intrusions1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, and campaigns promoting abandonment have sometimes led to backlash1, 7, 8, 10, 11 as they struggle to reconcile cultural tolerance with the conviction that cutting violates universal human rights1, 9. Cutting, however, is not necessarily locally pervasive and entrenched1, 3, 12. We designed experiments on cultural change that exploited the existence of conflicting attitudes within cutting societies. We produced four entertaining movies that served as experimental treatments in two experiments in Sudan, and we developed an implicit association test to unobtrusively measure attitudes about cutting. The movies depart from the view that cutting is locally pervasive by dramatizing members of an extended family as they confront each other with divergent views about whether the family should continue cutting. The movies significantly improved attitudes towards girls who remain uncut, with one in particular having a relatively persistent effect. These results show that using entertainment to dramatize locally discordant views can provide a basis for applied cultural evolution without accentuating intercultural divisions.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/127523","SDG":10}

We study the case of the Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6) that, under the leadership of J\u00f6rg Haider, increased its vote share from less than 5% in the early 1980s to 27% by the end of the 1990s and continued to attract more than 20% of voters in the 2013 national election. We find that the inflow of immigrants into a community has a significant impact on the increase in the community's voting share for the FP\u00d6, explaining roughly a tenth of the regional variation in vote changes. Our results suggest that voters worry about adverse labor market effects of immigration, as well as about the quality of their neighborhood. In fact, we find evidence of a negative impact of immigration on \u201ccompositional amenities\u201d. In communities with larger immigration influx, Austrian children commute longer distances to school, and fewer daycare resources are provided.

This lower risk is based both unconditionally and conditionally on bank-specific (microeconomic) variables as well as macroeconomic and market structure variables. Our findings indicate that the design and implementation of early warning systems for bank failure should recognize the distinct risk profiles of the two bank types.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/138887","SDG":10}

This paper experimentally tests a novel mechanism that seeks to mitigate elite capture of local development projects. Control communities are provided with block grants to fund local public goods, while households in treatment communities are provided with vouchers that they may either contribute to a public good or redeem at a discount for a private capital good. We find that the use of vouchers as a mechanism for aid delivery increases community participation in local public decision-making, changes the nature of allocation outcomes, and improves community satisfaction with allocation outcomes.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/168871","SDG":10}

We show that improving an airport\u2019s position in the network of air links has a positive effect on local economic activity, as captured by satellite-measured night lights. We find that air links increase business links, showing that the movement of people fosters the movement of capital. In particular, this is driven mostly by capital flowing from high-income to middle-income (but not low-income) countries. Taken together, our results suggest that increasing interconnectedness induces links between businesses and generates economic activity at the local level, but also gives rise to increased spatial inequality locally, and potentially globally.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/148139","SDG":10}

The present study explores the effects of the different components of right-wing populist communication\u2014anti-immigrant messages, populist content, and populist style\u2014on attitudes toward immigrants. By combining a media content analysis (N = 605 articles) with a panel survey (N = 1,968) in metropolitan areas of four Western European countries (France, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), this study analyzes how citizens\u2019 attitudes toward immigrants are influenced by the right-wing populist communication with which they are confronted in their individual media diet. The results show that anti-immigrant statements in the media lead to more negative cognitions toward immigrants, while populist content leads to more negative emotions. The study, thus, demonstrates that not only anti-immigrant rhetoric but also populism as a thin-centered ideology influence citizens\u2019 attitudes toward immigrants on top of pre-existing attitudes.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/158079","SDG":10}

Households in the rich North (poor South) are willing to pay high (low) prices for consumer goods; hence, unconstrained monopoly pricing generates arbitrage opportunities for internationally traded products. Export zeros arise because some northern firms abstain from exporting to the South, to avoid international arbitrage. Rich countries benefit from a trade liberalization, while poor countries lose. These results hold also under more general preferences with both extensive and intensive consumption margins. We show that a standard calibrated trade model (that ignores arbitrage) generates predictions on relative prices that violate no-arbitrage constraints in many bilateral trade relations. This suggests that international arbitrage is potentially important.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/137309","SDG":10}

We argue that surplus invariance is a reasonable requirement from a regulatory perspective, since the corresponding capital adequacy tests do not depend on the surplus of a financial institution, which benefits exclusively its shareholders, but only on the default profile, which affects its liability holders. We provide a detailed analysis of surplus-invariant acceptance sets and their associated risk measures and we discuss the link with loss-based and excess-invariant risk measures, recently studied by Cont et al.

Second, the same capacity constraints can generally explain its extensive participation in trust funds at other international development organizations. In the case of large global funds, however, Commission participation often reflects the outcome of member state politics.

There is, however, little agreement about its nature and its normative importance. This is due to the fact that the concept of autonomy as well as the moral relevance of autonomy are contested. It is argued in this paper that the debate about autonomy is at its core a debate about the reasons for respecting decisions. Decisions of persons are to be respected as their decisions, and they have to be respected as determining the deontic properties of situations. This, however, can only be understood against the background of persons having rights over themselves. Their decisions determine the deontic properties as exercises of their rights. Thus, respect for the autonomous choice of persons turns out to be respect for their rights.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/134491","SDG":10}

So far, the literature on issue voting has mostly focused on the role of issue entrepreneurs in politicizing new issues. In this article, however, we introduce policy change as a new potential determinant in the process of issue evolution. Moreover, in contrast to most of the literature that investigates the role of policy outcomes (such as economic growth or unemployment) on voting decisions, we analyze the effect of laws which can be directly attributed to governments and political parties. We focus on within-country variation and analyze national election surveys from the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany between 1994 and 2011. These surveys include information on both self- and party-placements regarding immigration issues. To measure policy changes, we use data on immigration policies from the newly built Immigration Policies in Comparison dataset. While we expect a general reform effect, we investigate in more detail whether liberal and restrictive reforms have a similar effect on votes for left\/right, government\/opposition parties. It is shown that both liberal and restrictive reforms lead to increasing issue voting.

The empirical analysis relies on the 2014\/2015 data from the immigration module of the European Social Survey (ESS) for West and East European countries. We find that universalistic individuals expressed lower threat due to immigration and higher support of immigration while conservative individuals displayed the opposite pattern. Symbolic threat mediated the association between values and immigration attitudes, but in most countries the mediation was partial. The associations between values, symbolic threat, and attitudes towards immigration were stronger in countries characterised by higher levels of intellectual and affective autonomy and weaker in countries characterised by higher levels of cultural embeddedness. The findings provide support for the centrality of human values in the formation of threat and attitudes towards immigration.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/168913","SDG":10}

While intergroup contact has received considerable attention in explaining ethnic threat, group relative deprivation (GRD), that is, feelings that one\u2019s group is unfairly deprived of desirable goods in comparison to relevant out-groups, has been largely ignored in cross-national research. Nevertheless, various smaller-scale studies have demonstrated that GRD can have a decisive impact on prejudice. In the current study, we examine the association between GRD and ethnic threat systematically across 20 European countries, thereby controlling for intergroup contact and value priorities. The 7th round of the European Social Survey (ESS) includes questions assessing respondents\u2019 feelings of group deprivation compared to immigrants and offers for the first time an opportunity to contextualise the threat-inducing effect of GRD across Europe. A multilevel structural equation model (MLSEM) demonstrates a considerable association between GRD and ethnic threat both on the individual and country levels. The results indicate that GRD is not only an important mediating factor between social structural positions and perceived threat, but also fully mediates the relation between contextual economic indicators and ethnic threat.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/168915","SDG":10}

We argue that different same-sex relationship policies vary in their impact. Whereas registered partnership laws construct a distinct target population that receives new benefits, marriage equality sends an unambiguously positive signal and reduces the perceived group difference through inclusion into existing rights. As a consequence, marriage equality should have a positive effect on attitudes toward homosexuality, whereas partnership laws should have much less positive effects and could even lead to backlash among some groups. Combining data from eight waves of the European Social Survey with data on legislation, we analyze the effects of same-sex marriage, registered partnerships, and marriage bans on attitudes toward gays and lesbians. Marriage has a positive effect, bans and registered partnerships have a negative effect. Legalized partnership is especially associated with significantly more negative attitudes among nonreligious and less educated people.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/170674","SDG":10}

Drawing on national survey data of adults in the United States, this article examines the online skills and behaviour of this group. Findings reveal diversity among older adults in internet skills and uses. Those with higher education and higher income have higher-level Web-use skills. While those of higher socioeconomic status are also more likely to use the internet for diverse types of activities from which they may benefit, once Controlling for skills, these differences are less pronounced.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/148144","SDG":0}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:148153","TITLE":"Unrealized Potential : Exploring the Digital Disability Divide","ABSTRACT":"While the digital inequality literature has considered differences in the online experiences of many population segments, relatively little work has examined how people with disabilities (PWD) have incorporated digital media into their lives. Based on a national survey of American adults, this paper explores this question through considering both barriers to Internet use and the possibilities the Internet offers PWD. Findings indicate barriers for many PWD to accessing the Internet. Those with five of six types of disabilities measured are considerably less likely to be online than those who are not disabled. People who are deaf or hearing impaired to do not lag in Internet access once we account for demographics, Web use skills, and Internet experiences. However, the study also finds evidence that once online, PWD engage in a range of uses of the Internet as much as people without disability. Moreover, PWD take distinct interest in certain online activities, such as sharing their own content and reviewing products and services, pointing to ways they may go online to adapt and respond to the wider inaccessible society. These findings indicate \r\ngreat potential for the Internet for people with disabilities and suggest that moving more of them online holds the potential for considerable gains among this group.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/148153","SDG":10}

Four core Internet usage types are constructed and predicted by sociodemographic variables in a structural model. Overall, the findings confirm the recently identified shift in the digital divide from access to usage in five further countries. Results show that sociodemographics alone account for up to half of the variance in usage in these high-penetration countries, with age being the strongest predictor. Measurement invariance tests indicate that a direct comparison is only valid between three of the five countries explored. Methodologically, this points to the indispensability of such tests for unbiased comparative research.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/112657","SDG":10}

We reinvestigate the impact of fragmentation in the context of growth, bureaucratic policy, and education, focusing on a number of conceptually different indicators of fragmentation, and paying attention to potentially heterogeneous effects across countries, sectors, and channels of influence. Our systematic and detailed reexamination of existing empirical studies shows that this differentiation is crucial. In some sectors\u2014such as primary education\u2014donor concentration or limiting donor numbers appear to be detrimental rather than beneficial for development outcomes. In other areas, we find the expected negative effect, but only when we conceptualize fragmentation as a lack of lead donors (too limited concentration), rather than in terms of donor numbers. In all cases, sufficient initial administrative capacity in recipient countries prevents the negative and reinforces the positive effects of fragmentation. This stresses the importance of questioning the sweeping conclusions drawn by much of the previous literature. Based on what we currently know, generalizing judgments about the effect of aid fragmentation may be misleading.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/144206","SDG":10}

Here, we analyzed the impacts of the different components of urban sprawl (i.e., scattered and widespread urban growth) on species richness of a variety of taxonomic groups covering mosses, vascular plants, gastropods, butterflies, and birds at the habitat and landscape scales. Besides urban area, we considered the average age,imperviousness, and dispersion degree of urban area, along with human population density, to disentangle the effects of the different components of urban sprawl on biodiversity. The study was carried out in the Swiss Plateau that has undergone substantial urban sprawl in recent decades.\r\nVascular plants and birds showed the strongest responses to urban sprawl, especially at the landscape scale, with non-native and ruderal plants proliferating and common generalist birds increasing at the expense of specialist birds as urban sprawl grew. Overall, urban area had the greatest contribution on such impacts, but additional effects of urban dispersion (i.e., increase of non-native plants) and human population density (i.e., increases of ruderal plants and common generalist birds) were found. Our findings support the hypothesis that negative impacts of urban sprawl on biodiversity can be reduced by compacting urban growth while still avoiding the formation of very densely populated areas.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/123659","SDG":11}

Explaining carpooling intention from the perspectives of carpooling passengers and drivers","ABSTRACT":"The negative impact of motorized private mobility on the environment can be decreased successfully by encouraging more people to carpool. From a psychological perspective, only little is known about the determinants of carpooling. Therefore, this study investigated carpooling behavior based on a theoretical background that integrates (1) the theory of planned behavior, (2) the norm activation model, and (3) dispositional trust. Additionally, we studied carpooling from two separate perspectives: Passengers sharing rides, and the drivers offering rides. We conducted a survey with a representative sample of 342 participants in Switzerland. The results showed that for both, passengers and drivers, normative aspects such as descriptive and personal norms, in combination with perceived behavioral control predicted carpooling intention. Attitude toward carpooling behavior, however, did not have any predictive power regarding carpooling intention, neither for passengers nor drivers. Dispositional trust displayed an indirect effect on intention to carpool as a passenger or driver via perceived behavioral control. Based on these results, we discuss practical implications for designing measures to promote carpooling successfully in the future.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/156902","SDG":11}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:116549","TITLE":"parkITsmart: minimization of cruising for parking","ABSTRACT":"Finding a parking space in urban areas is a daily challenge for drivers across the world, due to the increasing amount of vehicles and the limited amount of parking spaces. Drivers who are looking for a parking space in peak hours are often forced to drive around city blocks until they spot a free parking space. This process is termed in literature \u201ccruising for parking\u201d and is proven to (a) cost a lot of time and gas for drivers, (b) generate unnecessary traffic load, and (c) affect the environment negatively due to increased vehicle emissions. This work proposes a Parking Monitoring and Management System (PMMS) that collects, processes, and presents data about available parking spaces and their tariffs within a geographical region. The end-user application of the PMMS, parkITsmart, delivers at drivers bird\u2019s-eye view concerning the parking availability. To facilitate this, the PMMS gathers data from drivers\u2019, vehicles, their mobile phones, and Parking Inspectors (PIs). This work shows that in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) environment, \u201cpairing\u201d cars and drivers\u2019 mobile phones, collecting data from their sensors, and from PIs in a parking monitoring and management system, can decrease significantly cruising times for parking and can increase the time demands of the parking controlling process.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/116549","SDG":0}

The model covers softwood and hardwood markets for sawlogs, energy wood, and industrial wood. Our study region is a mountainous area in Switzerland that is close to the border, and therefore partially depends on the wood markets of the adjacent countries. The wood markets in this study region are characterized by many small-scale wood suppliers, and a mix of private and publicowned forests. The model was developed to investigate the availability of wood in the study region under different market conditions. We defined several scenarios that are relevant to policy makers and analyzed them with a focus on the two most important assortments of wood in the study region, namely, sawlogs softwood and energy wood softwood. The development of the prices and amounts sold in the scenarios are compared to a business-as-usual scenario. The scenarios were designed to investigate i) the influence of intermediaries, ii) the influence of the profit-orientation of forest owners, iii) the influence of the exchange rate, and iv) the consequences of set-asides in the study region. The presented model has a large potential to support the planning of policy measures as it allows capturing emergent phenomena, and thereby facilitates identifying potential consequences of policy measures planned prior to their implementation. This was demonstrated by discussing the scenario findings with respect to Switzerland's forestry policy objective of increasing the harvested amount of wood to the sustainable potential. We showed that a higher profit-orientation of forest owners would be beneficial for this objective, but also revealed potential conflicts of different economic goals.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/152581","SDG":12}

Our treatments exogenously vary consumers\u2019 incomes. Our experimental results reveal that growth in consumer income causes an increase in the share of socially responsible consumption in the laboratory.

We study experimentally whether people employ the argument \"if I don\u2019t do it, someone else will\" to justify taking a narrowly self-interested action. Our data reveal a clear pattern. Subjects do not employ the \"replacement excuse\" if a social norm exists that classifies the selfish action as immoral. But if no social norm exists, subjects are more inclined to take a selfish action in situations where another subject can otherwise take it. By demonstrating the importance of social norms of moral behavior for limiting the power of the replacement excuse, our paper informs the long-standing debate on the effect of markets on morals.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/139794","SDG":12}

However, in recent years, numerous scandals involving fraud have undermined confidence in the financial industry5, 6, 7. Contemporary commentators have attributed these scandals to the financial sector\u2019s business culture8, 9, 10, but no scientific evidence supports this claim. Here we show that employees of a large, international bank behave, on average, honestly in a control condition. However, when their professional identity as bank employees is rendered salient, a significant proportion of them become dishonest. This effect is specific to bank employees because control experiments with employees from other industries and with students show that they do not become more dishonest when their professional identity or bank-related items are rendered salient. Our results thus suggest that the prevailing business culture in the banking industry weakens and undermines the honesty norm, implying that measures to re-establish an honest culture are very important.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/110372","SDG":10}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:153142","TITLE":"Assessing Indirect Environmental Effects of Information and Communication Technology (ICT): A Systematic Literature Review","ABSTRACT":"Indirect environmental effects of information and communication technology (ICT) are those effects of ICT that change patterns of production or consumption in domains other than ICT, or more precisely, the environmental consequences of these changes. Digitalization as the societal process of ICT-driven change has created increasing interest in the indirect environmental effects of this technology. Assessments of indirect effects face various methodological challenges, such as the definition of the system boundary, the definition of a baseline as a reference or the occurrence of rebound effects. Existing studies use various approaches or methods to assess a spectrum of ICT use cases in several application domains. In view of the large number of assessments that have been conducted, the choices made when applying assessment methods, and the variety of ICT use cases in different application domains investigated, we present a systematic literature review of existing assessments of indirect environmental effects of ICT. The review provides a state-of-the-art overview of the methods used in the research field and is intended to support researchers in designing sound assessments which yield significant results. We identified 54 studies in seven main application domains using 15 different assessment approaches. The most common application domains are virtual mobility (e.g., telecommuting), virtual goods (e.g., digital media), and smart transport (e.g., route optimization). Life-cycle assessment, partial footprint, and the \u201cICT enablement method\u201d are the most common approaches. The major part of the assessments focuses on patterns of production (e.g., production of paper-based books vs. e-books), a smaller part on patterns of consumption (e.g., changes in media consumption). Based on these results, we identify as a research gap the investigation of ICT impacts on consumer behavior, which could, for example, focus on social practices, and account for the dynamic implications of change. Elaborating such an approach could provide valuable insights into ICT\u2019s impact on society and the resulting environmental consequences.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/153142","SDG":12}

The changing distribution of risks poses a threat to the legitimacy of business firms that normally derive their legitimacy from operating in compliance with the legal rules of democratic nation states. However, during the process of globalization, the regulatory power of nation states has been weakened and many production processes have been shifted to states with weak regulatory frameworks where businesses operate outside the reach of the democratic nation state. As a result, business firms have to address the various legitimacy challenges of their operations directly and cannot rely upon the legitimacy of their regulatory environment. These developments challenge the dominant approach to corporate governance that regards shareholders as the only stakeholder group in need of special protection due to risks not covered by contracts and legal regulations. On the basis of these considerations, we argue for a democratization of corporate governance structures in order to compensate for the governance deficits in their regulatory environment and to cope with the changing allocation of risks and costs. By way of democratic involvement of various stakeholders, business firms may be able to mitigate the redistribution of individual risk and address the resulting legitimacy deficits even when operating under conditions of regulatory gaps and governance failure.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/85053","SDG":0}

Considering that TGSs mainly address issues of public concern, the general public represents a major source of legitimacy in transnational governance. We theorize how members of the general public, whom we conceptualize as intuiters, apply heuristics to bestow legitimacy on TGSs. Given the difficulty of assessing TGSs, we argue that intuiters draw on affect-based responses towards a TGS's better-known network affiliates, such as participating business firms, to judge the legitimacy of the TGS as a whole. This substitution produces a \u201cvertical\u201d legitimacy spillover. More specifically, we examine the heuristic process of judgment underlying vertical spillovers in TGSs and derive implications for the legitimacy construct and the analysis of spillover phenomena.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/87341","SDG":12}

Indium, Neodymium, and Gold Flows Connected to the Use of Electronic Equipment in Switzerland","ABSTRACT":"The increased use of digital information and communications technologies (ICT) is giving rise to fast-growing waste streams that contain important material resources. In contrast to bulk materials and precious metals, the recovery of most critical metals has not yet been commercially established, and they are thus lost within the recycling process. In this article, we used dynamic material flow analysis to explore the stocks and flows of indium, neodymium, and gold incorporated in end-user devices in Switzerland. Our analysis covered the use, collection, recycling, and disposal phases. This enabled us to track the three metals from their entry into Switzerland as components of new devices until their recovery, disposal in landfills, or dissipation to the environment. Using statistical entropy analysis (SEA), we further analyzed the dilution or concentration of the metals during their route through the current system. The data uncertainty was addressed employing a probabilistic approach. The largest quantities of all three metals are found in the devices currently in use. The second-largest stocks are slags disposed in landfills for indium, slags used for construction for neodymium, and the output of metal recovery processes for gold. The SEA illustrates how the current collection and recycling system successfully concentrates all three metals. While 70% of gold leaving the use phase is recovered, indium and neodymium are dissipated to slags after smelting and incineration processes due to the lack of economic incentives and lacking recovery processes on a commercial scale.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/153143","SDG":12}

Data came from 300 respondents who participated in an online survey. Respondents were given a digital brochure to read containing information about a \u201cfictitious\u201d three-star beach hotel in Portugal, before completing a questionnaire that measured inter alia their intention to book this sustainable hotel. Both individual \u201cgeneral trust\u201d (perception of others\u2019 trustworthiness) and \u201cspecific trust\u201d towards the fictitious hotel in the brochure were measured. The survey also evaluated respondents\u2019 perceptions about the usefulness of the information in the brochure. Multiple regression analysis of the data indicated that general trust, trusting the hotel and perceived usefulness of the brochure were positively and significantly related to booking intentions. An interaction between general trust and perceived usefulness was also observed. This means that the higher the perception rate about the brochure's usefulness, the higher general trust was for booking intentions and vice versa. The practical implications of the results suggest that tourists could be motivated to book a hotel if its sustainability attributes and amenities were communicated in a trust inspiring way in marketing material.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/133478","SDG":12}

Examining individual-level data from five waves of the European Social Survey for 18 advanced democracies, we find that these effects vary by skill level and exposure. Offshoring increases preferences for liberal and center-right parties that advocate economic openness among the highly skilled. In contrast, low-skilled individuals exposed to offshoring are more likely to prefer leftist political parties that champion social protection and redistribution.

Production-specific and scaled-up results for life cycle assessment (LCA) and production costs are combined in a new analysis to identify synergetic improvement potentials and trade-offs, setting goals for the eco-design of new processes. The identified hotspots and bottlenecks will help users to focus on the relevant steps for improvements from an eco-efficiency perspective and potentially reduce their associated environmental impacts and production costs. Our method is illustrated with a case study of nanocellulose. The results indicate that the production route should start with carrot pomace, use heat and solvent recovery, and deactivate the enzymes with bleach instead of heat. To further improve the process, the results show that focus should be laid on the carrier polymer, sodium alginate, and the production of the GripX coating. Overall, the method shows that the underlying LCA scale-up framework is valuable for purposes beyond conventional LCA studies and is applicable at a very early stage to provide researchers with a better understanding of their production process.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/151674","SDG":12}

The conventional multi-step process for the production of methansulfonic acid is based on the reaction of methanol and hydrogen sulfide to form methanthiol which is used to produce dimethyldisulfate. The dimethyldisulfate reacts further with nitric acid to form methanesulfonic acid. A newly developed process presents the possibility to form methanesulfonic acid directly from methane and sulfur trioxide in a single step at mild conditions. Thus this process enables for the first time the production of a high value chemical through direct activation of methane on an industrial scale. The cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment conducted with the ReCiPe Method revealed that this direct process has a total environmental impact that is 3 times lower than that of the conventional process. The differences resulted from lower energy requirements and alternative reactants used in the direct process. The results therefore demonstrate the potential for methane extracted from natural gas as a greener alternative to oil as a chemical feedstock in the medium term.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/157157","SDG":12}

Sustainable product design uses multi-criteria decision methods to select the best material or process from a set of alternatives, requiring that the target product is already known. This paper follows a contrary approach by introducing the Multi-Perspective Application Selection, a method to support researchers and industrial practitioners alike in identifying and choosing the most promising and sustainable applications for new materials under development. This is achieved through combining and assessing technical, economic and environmental criteria covering the entire life cycle of an application. With this method, numerous possible applications can be screened during the early stages of material development when little information is available. The results help to narrow the selection of feasible products by excluding unpromising applications. The first step involves identifying and segmenting potential markets. In the second step, technical and economic aspects are assessed by employing user acceptance criteria. Finally, simplified life cycle assessment calculations are implemented in the third step to cover environmental considerations. Using an example of cellulose nanofiber reinforced composites, the authors illustrate the procedure whereby luxury consumer goods, specialty vehicles, industrial processing and furniture result as the most promising applications identified from this new method. The results give the researchers a more holistic understanding of their material and help to establish the requirements that the material must fulfill for the selected application. With that knowledge, the method can help enact development pathways in applied materials research.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/132130","SDG":12}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:159722","TITLE":"Multimodal route planning with public transport and carpooling","ABSTRACT":"Increasing mobility demands raise the pressure on existing transport networks. As the most used mode of transport, private cars have a particularly strong environmental impact and produce congestion. Ridesharing or carpooling, where a driver and several riders form a carpool, can help to address these issues by increasing the number of persons per car. Therefore, recent years have seen a strong interest in carpooling. However, there exists no effective method of integrating carpooling into transport trip planners as of now, mainly due to the fuzzy and flexible nature e.g., no fixed stops, possibility of making detours of carpooling. This hinders the acceptance of carpooling by the general public. This paper proposes a new method to merge public transport and carpooling networks for multimodal route planning, considering the fuzziness and flexibility brought by carpooling. It is based on the concept of drive-time areas and points of action. The evaluation with real-world data sets shows that, compared with the state-of-the-art method, the proposed method merges static i.e., public transport and dynamic\/fuzzy i.e., carpooling networks better, while retaining the desired flexibility offered by the latter, and thus creates a higher interconnectivity between the networks. Meanwhile, the merged network enables multimodal route planning, which can provide users with trips from an origin to a destination using different combinations of modes.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/159722","SDG":11}

We test this arguments here using data from four election studies in Denmark and Germany that explicitly ask respondents to rate parties on one particular luxury goods issue: protection of the environment. Voters who perceive the economy as weak indeed punish governing parties more severely when they associate them with environmental policies; conversely, a green reputation when the economy is expanding garners left-wing parties higher vote probabilities. Right-wing governing parties fare similarly, benefitting from those who perceive them as green when the economy is hale, albeit only converging to the vote probabilities awarded from voters who see them as less green when the economy sours.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/143184","SDG":0}

Following from the expected electoral effects of issue politicization, the success of radical right and green parties will cause different reactions from mainstream parties. While mainstream parties emphasize anti-immigrant positions in response to radical right success, green party success will have the opposite effect for environmental issues. Since green parties constitute issue owners, their success will make established parties de-emphasize the environment. Analyzing time-series cross-section data for sixteen Western European countries from 1980 to 2011, this article empirically establishes that green and radical right parties differ in their effect on mainstream party behavior and that their impact depends on the ideological position and past electoral performance of the mainstream parties.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/143565","SDG":0}

However, the yield of SNF is usually very low (<< 1 %). After coating reactions, excessive organosilane residues become wastes and are released to the environment. Here, we report a facile, sustainable, high yield strategy to prepare silicone nanofilament coatings by simply exposing trifunctional silane\/toluene solution to air. When toluene is exposed to air with relative humidity between 30% and 45%, it can trap a suitable amount of water which enables fast and continuous growth of SNF on different substrates. This new finding not only simplifies the fabrication procedure but also enables the preparation of SNF coatings in a sustainable, high-yield manner. Such a novel technique allows the preparation of superhydrophobic samples on a large scale-hundreds of samples can be prepared in less than 1 day by simply using a mother solution containing a small amount of trifunctional silane.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/143474","SDG":12}

The Case of Activism for the Global South and Fair Trade","ABSTRACT":"Political consumption is a flourishing field of research at the intersection of consumer research and political sociology. Political consumption means the consideration of ethical or political motives in the decision to buy certain products. Its main forms are the buying (buycott) of products distinguished by certain ethical or political characteristics such as sustainability, social justice, or corporate responsibility, and the boycott of products that lack such characteristics. However, there is an ongoing discussion about the status of political consumption. Some authors suspect that it may distract citizens from more challenging forms of participation (crowding-out thesis). In contrast, most empirical research has shown that political consumers are also more active than the general population in other forms of political participation. However, this has only been shown for fairly general measures of political consumption and participation. Our contribution to this debate thus focuses on one specific form of political consumption and corresponding forms of participation: activism for the Global South and fair trade consumption, zooming in on the case of Switzerland, where fair trade consumption is quite widespread within the population. Our results show that fair trade consumption is only weakly related to other forms of engagement for Global South issues, thus it does not distract from more challenging forms of engagement, but it is also not part of a more general engaged lifestyle. This is supported by the fact that the motivations and structural underpinnings of other forms of activism for the Global South differ from those of fair trade consumption.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/149191","SDG":12}

Using Twitter data of 3000 users, we could identify 7 distinct communities that varied in terms of their size, position, and contribution to the debate. The most dominant communities in the debate were the Conservative Mainstream and the Green-Left communities. Moreover, our findings show that communities supporting and opposing the initiative differ with regard to the wording they use in their tweets. Finally, our results reveal an active exchange both within and, even more importantly, between the communities, which indicates a rather pluralistic and internally connected debate. Thus, our findings clearly contrast with those of prior studies concerning political debates on social media that identified pronounced echo chambers.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/159664","SDG":0}

Accordingly, there is a breadth of often-used survey instruments available which have also been adopted for segmentation analyses. Even though many of these segmentation solutions are similar in their aims, they often include a large numbers of variables, making it more difficult for other researchers to build on these solutions, as survey time is scarce. Therefore, we demonstrate how a large number of variables that were used for a comprehensive segmentation analysis can be reduced considerably without losing too much information. We develop and test a short survey instrument to segment populations according to their attitudes toward science. Results show that segmentation results can be replicated with over 90% accuracy by reducing the instrument from 20 to 10 variables. This reduction does not significantly affect the predictive power of segment attribution on three dependent variables, which suggests that many segmentation analyses could be similarly optimized, helping researchers save survey time and standardize segmentation analyses more.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/158953","SDG":0}

Not only do they vote for different parties, buy different products, have different hobbies and use different media.

This has been shown for people\u2019s general assessments of environmental issues (e.g. Eurobarometer, 2017) and of science and research (for an overview see Besley, 2013).

These differences are not randomly distributed across populations. Researchers from the social and behavioral sciences have identified the organizing logics that underlie this diversity, and identified factors which help explain the variation of people\u2019s attitudes.

The study reported here was designed to investigate the associations between perceived benefits, perceived costs, and perceived value while booking a sustainable hotel. In addition, the moderating role of scepticism is assessed relating the paths linking the study variables. The study is based on an online survey carried out with1056 respondents in the USA. The results of structural equation modeling indicate that the perceived benefits, both authentic and environmental benefits were significantly influencing perceived value; and perceived value had a significant influence on booking intentions. The moderating effect of scepticism on authentic benefit perceptions with perceived value suggests that when respondents are sceptical about sustainability in general, it alters the relationship between authentic benefit perceptions and perceived value showing a negative impact. The study provides implications for sustainable hotel marketing by emphasising the need to understand how potential consumers perceive the sustainable product value and how this affects their booking intentions.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/161636","SDG":8}

Putting commodity chain analysis literature into conversation with recent \u2018flex crop\u2019 debates, we analyse the roles of actors along star anise commodity chains originating in rural, upland northern Vietnam. Our qualitative fieldwork reveals the intricate and idiosyncratic nature of these commodity chains upon which ethnic minority cultivator livelihoods depend, and which connect uplands and lowlands through manifold linkages. Cultivators, intermediaries, wholesalers, exporters and marketplace traders are constantly having to renegotiate their positions along these chains to maintain viable livelihoods due to uncertain financial returns and shifting demands. Adding to livelihood insecurities, financial gains have fluctuated wildly over time. The segmented knowledge individuals have of these commodity chains keep many in a vulnerable position, while the Vietnamese state's approach to promoting this commodity as a way to improve local livelihoods is questionable.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/147533","SDG":12}

Recent laboratory studies have provided enhanced understanding of rock fatigue and fracturing in cold environments but were not successfully confirmed by field studies. This study presents a unique time series of fracture kinematics, rock temperatures and environmental conditions at 3500\u2006m\u2006a.\u2009s.\u2009l.\u2009 on the steep, strongly fractured H\u00f6rnligrat of the Matterhorn (Swiss Alps). Thanks to 8 years of continuous data, the longer-term evolution of fracture kinematics in permafrost can be analyzed with an unprecedented level of detail. Evidence for common trends in spatiotemporal pattern of fracture kinematics could be found: a partly reversible seasonal movement can be observed at all locations, with variable amplitudes. In the wider context of rock slope stability assessment, we propose separating reversible (elastic) components of fracture kinematics, caused by thermoelastic strains, from the irreversible (plastic) component due to other processes. A regression analysis between temperature and fracture displacement shows that all instrumented fractures exhibit reversible displacements that dominate fracture kinematics in winter. Furthermore, removing this reversible component from the observed displacement enables us to quantify the irreversible component. From this, a new metric \u2013 termed index of irreversibility \u2013 is proposed to quantify relative irreversibility of fracture kinematics. This new index can identify periods when fracture displacements are dominated by irreversible processes. For many sensors, irreversible enhanced fracture displacement is observed in summer and its initiation coincides with the onset of positive rock temperatures. This likely indicates thawing-related processes, such as meltwater percolation into fractures, as a forcing mechanism for irreversible displacements. For a few instrumented fractures, irreversible displacements were found at the onset of the freezing period, suggesting that cryogenic processes act as a driving factor through increasing ice pressure. The proposed analysis provides a tool for investigating and better understanding processes related to irreversible kinematics.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/135609","SDG":13}

However, glacier retreat and its climatic controls have not been assessed at the pan-Arctic scale. Consequently, the spatial and temporal variability in the magnitude of retreat, and the possible drivers are uncertain. Here we use remotely sensed data acquired over 273 outlet glaciers, located across the entire Atlantic Arctic (i.e. areas potentially influenced by North Atlantic climate and\/or ocean conditions, specifically: Greenland, Novaya Zemlya, Franz Josef Land and Svalbard), to demonstrate high-magnitude, accelerating and near-ubiquitous retreat between 1992 and 2010. Overall, mean retreat rates increased by a factor of 3.5 between 1992 and 2000 (\u221230.5 m a\u22121) and 2000\u201310 (\u2212105.8 m a\u22121), with 97% of the study glaciers retreating during the latter period. The Retreat was greatest in northern, western and south-eastern Greenland and also increased substantially on the Barents Sea coast of Novaya Zemlya. Glacier retreat showed no significant or consistent relationship with summer air temperatures at decadal timescales. The rate of frontal position change showed a significant, but weak, correlation with changes in sea-ice concentrations. We highlight large variations in retreat rates within regions and suggest that fjord topography plays an important role. We conclude that marine-terminating Arctic outlet glaciers show a common response of rapid and accelerating retreat at decadal timescales.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/145470","SDG":13}

However, the link between MSGLs and rapid ice flow is largely qualitative, and there have been few attempts to quantitatively link their formation to ice flow characteristics (e.g. ice velocity, thickness, basal shear stress). We take measurements of MSGLs from a palaeo-ice stream that once occupied Marguerite Trough, Antarctic Peninsula and explore a range of possible correlations with ice dynamics generated from an ensemble of numerical modelling experiments that reproduce the deglaciation of the ice stream. Our results confirm that high mean ice velocities and a weak bed correlate with longer MSGLs. Furthermore, the height of MSGLs are low (2\u20133 m) where modelled basal shear stress is low, but their height tends to be higher and more variable where basal shear stress is larger. The mean density of MSGLs decreases as ice flux increases. Our analysis further suggests that the length of MSGLs is a function of basal ice velocity and time. Although our data\/model correlations confirm the importance of ice velocity in MSGL formation, a significant challenge remains if we are to employ MSGLs as a quantifiable measure of past ice stream velocity.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/130746","SDG":13}

Using the example of bar-headed geese we estimated migratory connectivity at a landscape level throughout the annual cycle in their native range.\r\nMethods We used tracking data of bar-headed geese to develop a multi-state movement model and to estimate temporally explicit habitat suitability within the species\u2019 range. We simulated migratory movements between range fragments, and calculated a measure we called route viability. The results are compared to expectations derived from published literature.\r\nResults Simulated migrations matched empirical trajectories in key characteristics such as stopover duration. The viability of the simulated trajectories was similar to that of the empirical trajectories. We found that, overall, the migratory connectivity was higher within the breeding than in wintering areas, corroborating previous findings for this species.\r\nConclusions We show how empirical tracking data and environmental information can be fused for meaningful predictions of animal movements throughout the year and even outside the spatial range of the available data. Beyond predicting migratory connectivity, our framework will prove useful for modelling ecological processes facilitated by animal movement, such as seed dispersal or disease ecology.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/151370","SDG":0}

Is aid used strategically to influence the negotiations in this context, too? Based on a novel dataset on negotiation behavior under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change we assess whether countries obtaining aid react by expressing increased support and\/or reduced opposition towards the donor. Applying linear and instrumental variable regressions on a three-dimensional panel dataset with donor-recipient dyads for the period 2002-2013 enables us to distinguish between long-term partnerships and the strategic use of aid for the purpose of the negotiations. We find that aid can indeed buy support in the climate negotiations, but that this opportunity tends to be limited to mitigation and adaptation aid, rather than general aid. We argue that this is due to both greater demand for and greater supply of these specific types of aid, whose allocation is under the direct responsibility of the specialized delegates participating in the negotiations.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/141266","SDG":13}

Using a numerical flowline model we investigate the controls on grounding line motion across the eastern Weddell Sea and compare our results with field data relating to past ice extent. Specifically, we investigate the influence of changes in ice temperature, accumulation, sea level, ice shelf basal melt, and ice shelf buttressing on the dynamics of the Foundation Ice Stream. We find that ice shelf basal melt plays an important role in controlling grounding line advance, while a reduction in ice shelf buttressing is found to be necessary for grounding line retreat. There are two stable positions for the grounding line under glacial conditions: at the northern margin of Berner Island and at the continental shelf break. Global mean sea-level contributions associated with these two scenarios are ~50mm and ~130 mm, respectively. Comparing model results with field evidence from the Pensacola Mountains and the Shackleton Range, we find it unlikely that ice was grounded at the continental shelf break for a prolonged period during the last glacial cycle. However, we cannot rule out a brief advance to this position or a scenario in which the grounding line retreated behind present during deglaciation and has since re-advanced. Better constraints on past ice sheet and ice shelf geometry, ocean temperature, and ocean circulation are needed to reconstruct more robustly past behavior of the Foundation Ice Stream.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/145477","SDG":13}

In order to understand the changes in glacier coverage at various scales and to model past and future streamflow accurately, long-term and large-scale datasets of glacier outlines are needed. To fill the gap between the morphologically reconstructed glacier outlines from the moraine extent corresponding to the time period around 1850 and the first complete dataset of glacier areas in the Swiss Alps from aerial photographs in 1973, glacier areas from 80 sheets of a historical topographic map (the Siegfried map) were manually digitized for the publication years 1878\u20131918 (further called first period, with most sheets being published around 1900) and 1917\u20131944 (further called second period, with most sheets being published around 1935). The accuracy of the digitized glacier areas was then assessed through a two-step validation process: the data were (1) visually and (2) quantitatively compared to glacier area datasets of the years 1850, 1973, 2003, and 2010, which were derived from different sources, at the large scale, basin scale, and locally. The validation showed that at least 70\u202f% of the digitized glaciers were comparable to the outlines from the other datasets and were therefore plausible. Furthermore, the inaccuracy of the manual digitization was found to be less than 5\u202f%. The presented datasets of glacier outlines for the first and second periods are a valuable source of information for long-term glacier mass balance or hydrological modelling in glacierized basins. The uncertainty of the historical topographic maps should be considered during the interpretation of the results.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/151147","SDG":13}

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:152148","TITLE":"Hydrological modeling to evaluate climate model simulations and their bias correction","ABSTRACT":"Variables simulated by climate models are usually evaluated independently. Yet, climate change impacts often stem from the combined effect of these variables, making the evaluation of intervariable relationships essential. These relationships can be evaluated in a statistical framework (e.g., using correlation coefficients), but this does not test whether complex processes driven by nonlinear relationships are correctly represented. To overcome this limitation, we propose to evaluate climate model simulations in a more process-oriented framework using hydrological modeling. Our modeling chain consists of 12 regional climate models (RCMs) from the Coordinated Downscaling Experiment\u2013European Domain (EURO-CORDEX) forced by five general circulation models (GCMs), eight Swiss catchments, 10 optimized parameter sets for the hydrological model Hydrologiska Byr\u00e5ns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV), and one bias correction method [quantile mapping (QM)]. We used seven discharge metrics to explore the representation of different hydrological processes under current climate. Specific combinations of biases in GCM\u2013RCM simulations can lead to significant biases in simulated discharge (e.g., excessive precipitation in the winter months combined with a cold temperature bias). Other biases, such as exaggerated snow accumulation, do not necessarily impact temperature over the historical period to the point where discharge is affected. Our results confirm the importance of bias correction; when all catchments, GCM\u2013RCMs, and discharge metrics were considered, QM improved discharge simulations in the vast majority of all cases. Additionally, we present a ranking of climate models according to their hydrological performance. Ranking GCM\u2013RCMs is most meaningful prior to bias correction since QM reduces differences between GCM\u2013RCM-driven hydrological simulations. Overall, this work introduces a multivariate assessment method of GCM\u2013RCMs, which enables a more process-oriented evaluation of their simulations.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/152148","SDG":13}

Microhabitats in the soil \u2013 such as within and outside of aggregates, in the detritusphere, and\/or in the rhizosphere \u2013 are considered to promote and preserve specific redox conditions. Yet our understanding of the relative effects of such microhabitats and their interactions on N2O production and consumption in soils is still incomplete. Therefore, we assessed the effect of aggregate size, buried leaf litter, and plant\u2013soil interactions on the occurrence of enhanced N2O emissions under simulated flooding\/drying conditions in a mesocosm experiment. We used two model soils with equivalent structure and texture, comprising macroaggregates (4000\u2013250\u2009\u00b5m) or microaggregates (<250\u2009\u00b5m) from a N-rich floodplain soil. These model soils were planted with basket willow (Salix viminalis L.), mixed with leaf litter or left unamended. After 48\u2009h of flooding, a period of enhanced N2O emissions occurred in all treatments. The unamended model soils with macroaggregates emitted significantly more N2O during this period than those with microaggregates. Litter addition modulated the temporal pattern of the N2O emission, leading to short-term peaks of high N2O fluxes at the beginning of the period of enhanced N2O emission. The presence of S. viminalis strongly suppressed the N2O emission from the macroaggregate model soil, masking any aggregate-size effect. Integration of the flux data with data on soil bulk density, moisture, redox potential and soil solution composition suggest that macroaggregates provided more favourable conditions for spatially coupled nitrification\u2013denitrification, which are particularly conducive to net N2O production. The local increase in organic carbon in the detritusphere appears to first stimulate N2O emissions; but ultimately, respiration of the surplus organic matter shifts the system towards redox conditions where N2O reduction to N2 dominates. Similarly, the low emission rates in the planted soils can be best explained by root exudation of low-molecular-weight organic substances supporting complete denitrification in the anoxic zones, but also by the inhibition of denitrification in the zone, where rhizosphere aeration takes place. Together, our experiments highlight the importance of microhabitat formation in regulating oxygen (O2) content and the completeness of denitrification in soils during drying after saturation. Moreover, they will help to better predict the conditions under which hot spots, and \u201chot moments\u201d, of enhanced N2O emissions are most likely to occur in hydrologically dynamic soil systems like floodplain soils.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/168741","SDG":13}

Our knowledge of the impacts of forest expansion and development on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage is, however, limited due to uncertainties in land-use history and lack of historical soil samples. We investigated the effect of forest age on current SOC storage in Switzerland. For 857 sites, we analysed SOC stocks and determined the minimal forest age for all presently forested sites using digitized historical maps, classifying all sites into three categories: young (\u226460 years), medium (60\u2013120 years), and old (\u2265120 years) forests. Grassland was the primary previous use of afforested land. Forest age affected current SOC stocks only moderately, whereas climate, soil chemistry, and tree species exerted a stronger impact. In the organic layer, highest SOC stocks were found in medium sites ($3.0 \\pm 0.3 kg C m^{\u22122}$). As compared to other age categories, these sites had a 10% higher cover in coniferous forests with higher organic layer C stocks than broadleaf forests. SOC stocks in mineral soils decreased with increasing forest age ($12.5 \\pm 0.9, 11.4 \\pm 0.5, 10.5 \\pm 0.3 kg C m^{\u22122}$). This decrease was primarily related to a 200-m higher average elevation of young sites and higher SOC stocks in a colder and more humid climate. In summary, forest age has only a minor effect on SOC storage in Swiss forest soils. Therefore, ongoing forest expansion in mountainous regions of Europe is unlikely contributing to soil C sequestration.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/149847","SDG":13}

Soils have been, however, drastically altered by agricultural practices, such as nitrogen amendment which increases nitrous oxide emission while it reduces methane uptakes in well-aerated soils by affecting methane-oxidizing bacteria. New nitrification inhibitors, such as 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), are often applied in combination with nitrogen-based fertilizer to increase plant productivity by increasing available ammonium and inhibiting denitrification processes reducing in turn nitrous oxide emissions. However, the increase in ammonium due to nitrification inhibition might also affect methane oxidizing bacteria. We therefore investigated the effects of nitrogen-based fertilizer and DMPP on methane and nitrous oxide fluxes in an extensively managed grassland. We also determined the spatial distribution of active methane oxidizing bacteria by radiolabeling. Short-term reduction in methane uptake and methanotrophic activity occurred after application of 600 kg N ha\u22121 while DMPP did not alter methane uptake but reduced nitrous oxide emission. The combination of both radio-labeling and field measurement revealed that methane uptake collapsed in the field when methanotrophic activity was inhibited not only in the surface but also in deeper soil.

Particularly large temperature-effects might occur in cold ecosystems where critical processes are at their temperature limit.  In this study, we tested temperature effects on carbon (C) assimilate partitioning in a field experiment at the alpine treeline. We warmed and cooled soils of microcosms planted with Pinus mugo or Leucanthemopsis alpina, achieving daily mean soil temperatures (3-10 cm depth) around 5.8, 12.7 and 19.2\u00b0C in cooled, control and warmed soils. We pulse-labelled these systems with 14CO2 for one photoperiod and traced 14C over the successive four days. Plant net 14C uptake increased steadily with soil temperature. However, 14C amounts in fungal hyphae, soil microbial biomass, soil organic matter, and soil respiration showed a non-linear response to temperature. This non-linear pattern was particularly pronounced in P. mugo, with five times higher 14C activities in cooled compared to control soils, but no difference between warmed and control soil. Autoradiographic analysis of the spatial distribution of 14C in soils indicated that temperature effects on the vertical label distribution within soils depended on plant species. Our results show that plant growth, in particular root metabolism, is limited by low soil temperature. As a consequence, positive temperature effects on net C uptake may not be paralleled by similar changes in rhizodeposition. This has important implications for predictions of soil C storage, because rhizodeposits and plant biomass strongly vary in their residence time.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/120888","SDG":13}

Also, the latter are concentrated largely in the temperate zone. Tree species diversity generally is much higher in subtropical and tropical than in temperate or boreal forests, with reasons not fully understood. Niche overlap and thus complementarity in the use of resources that support productivity may be lower in forests than in herbaceous ecosystems, suggesting weaker productivity responses to diversity change in forests. We studied stand basal area, vertical structure, leaf area, and their relationship with tree species richness in a subtropical forest in south-east China. Permanent forest plots of 30 x 30 m were selected to span largely independent gradients in tree species richness and secondary successional age. Plots with higher tree species richness had a higher stand basal area. Also, stand basal area increases over a 4-year census interval were larger at high than at low diversity. These effects translated into increased carbon stocks in aboveground phytomass (estimated using allometric equations). A higher variability in tree height in more diverse plots suggested that these effects were facilitated by denser canopy packing due to architectural complementarity between species. In contrast, leaf area was not or even negatively affected by tree diversity, indicating a decoupling of carbon accumulation from leaf area. Alternatively, the same community leaf area might have assimilated more C per time interval in more than in less diverse plots because of differences in leaf turnover and productivity or because of differences in the display of leaves in vertical and horizontal space. Overall, our study suggests that in species-rich forests niche-based processes support a positive diversity\u2013productivity relationship and that this translates into increased carbon storage in long-lived woody structures. Given the high growth rates of these forests during secondary succession, our results further indicate that a forest management promoting tree diversity after disturbance may accelerate CO2 sequestration from the atmosphere and thus be relevant in a climate-change context.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/131341","SDG":13}

Net soil-atmosphere CH4 fluxes are determined by the balance of soil microbially-driven methane (CH4) oxidation and methanogenesis, and both might change under elevated CO2.\r\nMethods and Results: Here, we studied CH4 dynamics in a permanent grassland exposed to elevated CO2 for 14 years. Soil-atmosphere fluxes of CH4 were measured using large static chambers, over a period of four years. The ecosystem was a net sink for atmospheric CH4 for most of the time except summer to fall when net CH4 emissions occurred. We did not detect any elevated CO2 effects on CH4 fluxes, but emissions were difficult to quantify due to their discontinuous nature, most likely because of ebullition from the saturated zone. Potential methanotrophic activity, determined by incubation of fresh sieved soil under standardized conditions, also did not reveal any effect of the CO2 treatment. Finally, we determined the spatial micro-distribution of methanotrophic activity at less than 5\u00d7 atmospheric (10 ppm) and elevated (10000 ppm) CH4 concentrations, using a novel auto-radiographic technique. These analyses indicated that domains of net CH4 assimilation were distributed throughout the analyzed top 15 cm of soils, with no dependence on CH4 concentration or CO2 treatment.\r\nConclusions: Our investigations suggest that elevated CO2 exerts no or only minor effects on CH4 fluxes in the type of ecosystem we studied, at least as long as soil moisture differences are small or absent as was the case here. The autoradiographic analyses further indicate that the spatial niche of CH4 oxidation does not shift in response to CO2 enrichment or CH4 concentration, and that the same type of methanotrophs may oxidize CH4 from atmospheric and soil-internal sources.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/111494","SDG":13}

Local population responses to such environmental perturbations are generally well understood, but in socially structured populations, interactions between environmental and social factors may influence population responses. Thus, understanding how habitat degradation affects the dynamics of these populations requires simultaneous consideration of social and environmental mechanisms underlying demographic responses. Here we investigated the effect of habitat degradation through commercial forestry on spatiotemporal dynamics of a group-living bird, the Siberian jay, Perisoreus infaustus, in boreal forests of northern Sweden. We assessed the interacting effects of forestry, climate and population density on stage-specific, seasonal life-history rates and population dynamics, using long-term, individual-based demographic data from 70 territories in natural and managed forests. Stage-specific survival and reproductive rates, and consequently population growth, were lower in managed forests than in natural forests. Population growth was most sensitive to breeder survival and was more sensitive to early dispersing juveniles than those delaying dispersal. Forestry decreased population growth in managed forests by reducing reproductive success and breeder survival. Increased snow depth improved winter survival, and warmer spring temperatures enhanced reproductive success, particularly in natural forests. Population growth was stable in natural forests but it was declining in managed forests, and this difference accelerated under forecasted climate scenarios. Thus, climatic change could exacerbate the rate of forestry-induced population decline through reduced snow cover in our study species, and in other species with similar life-history characteristics and habitat requirements.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/168432","SDG":15}

We studied the effects of grassland species richness (1-16) in combination with application of fertilizer (nitrogen:phosphorus:potassium = 100:43.6:83 kg ha(-1) a(-1)) on N2O and CH4 fluxes in a long-term field experiment. Soil N2O emissions, measured over 2 years using static chambers, decreased with species richness unless fertilizer was added. N2O emissions increased with fertilization and the fraction of legumes in plant communities. Soil CH4 uptake, a process driven by methanotrophic bacteria, decreased with plant species numbers, irrespective of fertilization. Using structural equation models, we related trace gas fluxes to soil moisture, soil inorganic N concentrations, nitrifying and denitrifying enzyme activity, and the abundance of ammonia oxidizers, nitrite oxidizers, and denitrifiers (quantified by real-time PCR of gene fragments amplified from microbial DNA in soil). These analyses indicated that plant species richness increased soil moisture, which in turn increased N cycling-related activities. Enhanced N cycling increased N2O emission and soil CH4 uptake, with the latter possibly caused by removal of inhibitory ammonium by nitrification. The moisture-related indirect effects were surpassed by direct, moisture-independent effects opposite in direction. Microbial gene abundances responded positively to fertilizer but not to plant species richness. The response patterns we found were statistically robust and highlight the potential of plant biodiversity to interact with climatic change through mechanisms unrelated to carbon storage and associated carbon dioxide removal.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/131343","SDG":13}

A better understanding of how environmental factors shape plant structure and function is crucial for predicting the consequences of environmental change for ecosystem functioning. Here we explore the biome-wide relationships between temperature, moisture and seven key plant functional traits both across space and over three decades of warming at 117 tundra locations. Spatial temperature\u2013trait relationships were generally strong but soil moisture had a marked influence on the strength and direction of these relationships, highlighting the potentially important influence of changes in water availability on future trait shifts in tundra plant communities. Community height increased with warming across all sites over the past three decades, but other traits lagged far behind predicted rates of change. Our findings highlight the challenge of using space-for-time substitution to predict the functional consequences of future warming and suggest that functions that are tied closely to plant height will experience the most rapid change.

As such an important biological resource, it is necessary to understand how the effects of climate change will impact this keystone species; in particular the frequency of drought, which is likely to affect tortoise habitat. To assess whether drought frequency has changed over the last 50 years on Aldabra, we calculated the standardized, precipitation index (SPI) to identify drought periods using monthly rainfall data collected during 1969\u20132013. We found that drought frequency has increased to more than six drought months per year today compared with about two months per year in the 1970s (t =2.884, p=0.006). We used MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy for vegetation activity, to determine how vegetation has responded to the changing drought frequency between 2000 and 2013. We found that Aldabra\u2019s vegetation is highly responsive to changes in rainfall: anomalies in long-term mean monthly NDVI across Aldabra were found to decrease below the mean during most drought periods and increase above the mean during most non-drought periods. To investigate the response of tortoise habitat to rainfall, we extracted mean NDVI anomalies for three key habitat types. Open mixed scrub and grasslands, the preferred habitat of tortoises, showed the greatest decrease in vegetation activity during drought periods, and the greatest increase in average greenness during non-drought periods. Recent analysis has shown vegetation changes on Aldabra in recent decades. If these changes are caused by decreased precipitation, then the increased frequency of drought could impact the tortoise population, in both the short and long term, by limiting the quality and quantity of forage and\/or shade availability within favoured habitats, and by changing the habitat composition across the atoll.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/138693","SDG":15}

Despite the importance of shrub\u2013climate feedbacks, uncertainties about shrub growth sensitivity to climate remain. Here, we explored the indirect effects of climate warming on shrub growth (vertical and radial), bark thickness, and bark investment in four arctic shrub species. We combined a field experiment addressing two suggested growth drivers \u2013 thawing depth and nutrient availability \u2013 with dendroecology in a Siberian tundra ecosystem. We used heating cables to increase the thawing depth. To enhance the nutrient availability, we fertilized the surface soil layers. We found that shrub growth was mainly limited by nutrient availability, as indicated by the fertilization treatment effects on shrub growth ring widths. We also found a bark thickness decrease with the combined soil heating and nutrient addition treatment and a negative correlation between bark investment and growth rate for two of the species. These findings suggest that tundra shrubs, especially deciduous species, will grow faster and taller driven by an increasing nutrient availability in the surface soil layers. However, shrubs might become more vulnerable to pests, herbivory, and climate extremes, such as frost or drought events, due to thinner bark and lower bark investment. Using dendroecological approaches in field experiments simulating projected climate scenarios for the Arctic, and an increasing number of study species and locations will reduce uncertainties related to shrub growth sensitivity to climate and other processes driving shrub dynamics.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/144914","SDG":13}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:130718","TITLE":"Contrasting radiation and soil heat fluxes in Arctic shrub and wet sedge tundra","ABSTRACT":"Vegetation changes, such as shrub encroachment and wetland expansion, have been observed in many Arctic tundra regions. These changes feed back to permafrost and climate. Permafrost can be protected by soil shading through vegetation as it reduces the amount of solar energy available for thawing. Regional climate can be affected by a reduction in surface albedo as more energy is available for atmospheric and soil heating. Here, we compared the shortwave radiation budget of two common Arctic tundra vegetation types dominated by dwarf shrubs (Betula nana) and wet sedges (Eriophorum angustifolium) in North-East Siberia. We measured time series of the shortwave and longwave radiation budget above the canopy and transmitted radiation below the canopy. Additionally, we quantified soil temperature and heat flux as well as active layer thickness. The mean growing season albedo of dwarf shrubs was 0.15\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01, for sedges it was higher (0.17\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02). Dwarf shrub transmittance was 0.36\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07 on average, and sedge transmittance was 0.28\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08. The standing dead leaves contributed strongly to the soil shading of wet sedges. Despite a lower albedo and less soil shading, the soil below dwarf shrubs conducted less heat resulting in a 17\u2009cm shallower active layer as compared to sedges. This result was supported by additional, spatially distributed measurements of both vegetation types. Clouds were a major influencing factor for albedo and transmittance, particularly in sedge vegetation. Cloud cover reduced the albedo by 0.01 in dwarf shrubs and by 0.03 in sedges, while transmittance was increased by 0.08 and 0.10 in dwarf shrubs and sedges, respectively. Our results suggest that the observed deeper active layer below wet sedges is not primarily a result of the summer canopy radiation budget. Soil properties, such as soil albedo, moisture, and thermal conductivity, may be more influential, at least in our comparison between dwarf shrub vegetation on relatively dry patches and sedge vegetation with higher soil moisture.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/130718","SDG":13}

Shrub expansion can modify climate by altering surface albedo, energy and water balance, and permafrost yet the drivers of shrub growth remain poorly understood. Dendroecological data consisting of multi-decadal time series of annual shrub growth provide an underused resource to explore climate\u2013growth relationships. Here, we analyse circumpolar data from 37 Arctic and alpine sites in 9 countries, including 25 species, and ~42,000 annual growth records from 1,821 individuals. Our analyses demonstrate that the sensitivity of shrub growth to climate was: (1) heterogeneous, with European sites showing greater summer temperature sensitivity than North American sites, and (2) higher at sites with greater soil moisture and for taller shrubs (for example, alders and willows) growing at their northern or upper elevational range edges. Across latitude, climate sensitivity of growth was greatest at the boundary between the Low and High Arctic, where permafrost is thawing and most of the global permafrost soil carbon pool is stored. The observed variation in climate\u2013shrub growth relationships should be incorporated into Earth system models to improve future projections of climate change impacts across the tundra biome.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/134740","SDG":13}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:104474","TITLE":"Arctic shrub effects on NDVI, summer albedo and soil shading","ABSTRACT":"The influence of Arctic vegetation on albedo, latent and sensible heat fluxes, and active layer thickness is a crucial link between boundary layer climate and permafrost in the context of climate change. Shrubs have been observed to lower the albedo as compared to lichen or graminoid-tundra. Despite its importance, the quantification of the effect of shrubification on summer albedo has not been addressed in much detail. We manipulated shrub density and height in an Arctic dwarf birch (Betula nana) shrub canopy to test the effect on shortwave radiative fluxes and on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a proxy for vegetation productivity used in satellite-based studies. Additionally, we parametrised and validated the 3D radiative transfer model DART to simulate the amount of solar radiation reflected and transmitted by an Arctic shrub canopy. We compared results of model runs of different complexities to measured data from North-East Siberia. We achieved comparably good results with simple turbid medium approaches, including both leaf and branch optical property media, and detailed object based model parameterisations. It was important to explicitly parameterise branches as they accounted for up to 71% of the total canopy absorption and thus contributed significantly to soil shading. Increasing leaf biomass resulted in a significant increase of the NDVI, decrease of transmitted photosynthetically active radiation, and repartitioning of the absorption of shortwave radiation by the canopy components. However, experimental and modelling results show that canopy broadband nadir reflectance and albedo are not significantly decreasing with increasing shrub biomass. We conclude that the leaf to branch ratio, canopy background, and vegetation type replaced by shrubs need to be considered when predicting feedbacks of shrubification to summer albedo, permafrost thaw, and climate warming.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/104474","SDG":13}

A joint consideration of peak discharges and hydrograph volumes, however, is crucial when assessing flood risks for current and future climate conditions. Here, we present a methodology to develop synthetic design hydrographs for future climate conditions that jointly consider peak discharges and hydrograph volumes. First, change factors are derived based on a regional climate model and are applied to observed precipitation and temperature time series. Second, the modified time series are fed into a calibrated hydrological model to simulate runoff time series for future conditions. Third, these time series are used to construct synthetic design hydrographs. The bivariate flood frequency analysis used in the construction of synthetic design hydrographs takes into account the dependence between peak discharges and hydrograph volumes, and represents the shape of the hydrograph. The latter is modeled using a probability density function while the dependence between the design variables peak discharge and hydrograph volume is modeled using a copula. We applied this approach to a set of eight mountainous catchments in Switzerland to construct catchment-specific and season-specific design hydrographs for a control and three scenario climates. Our work demonstrates that projected climate changes have an impact not only on peak discharges but also on hydrograph volumes and on hydrograph shapes both at an annual and at a seasonal scale. These changes are not necessarily proportional which implies that climate impact assessments on future floods should consider more flood characteristics than just flood peaks.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/141511","SDG":13}

Temperature can alter an individual's metabolic rate, and consequently birth and death rates. In declining populations, these alterations may manifest as changes in the rate of that population's decline, and subsequently the timing of extinction events. Predicting such events could therefore be of considerable use. We use a small-scale experimental system to investigate how the rate of temperature change can alter a population's time to extinction, and whether it is possible to predict this event using a simple phenomenological model that incorporates information about population dynamics at a constant temperature, published scaling of metabolic rates, and temperature. In addition, we examine 1) the relative importance of the direct effects of temperature on metabolic rate, and the indirect effects (via temperature driven changes in body size), on predictive accuracy (defined as the proximity of the predicted date of extinction to the mean observed date of extinction), 2) the combinations of model parameters that maximise accuracy of predictions, and 3) whether substituting temperature change through time with mean temperature produces accurate predictions. We find that extinction occurs earlier in environments that warm faster, and this can be accurately predicted (R2 > 0.84). Increasing the number of parameters that were temperature-dependent increased the model's accuracy, as did scaling these temperature-dependent parameters with either the direct effects of temperature alone, or with the direct and indirect effects. Using mean temperature through time instead of actual temperature produces less accurate predictions of extinction. These results suggest that simple phenomenological models, incorporating metabolic theory, may be useful in understanding how environmental change can alter a population's rate of extinction.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/87012","SDG":13}

To study changes of its habitat, we assessed the spatio-temporal metalimnetic boundaries by applying low-pass filtering and binary thresholding to temperature profiles of long-term data (1978\u20132013, weekly measurements). Due to increasing temperatures over the last 3.5 decades, the onset and duration of metalimnion formation changed significantly (stratification increased by 33 days). Moreover, the upper metalimnetic boundary has undergone a significant drawdown of 2.3 m, accounting for an overall decrease in metalimnion thickness. Being the most abundant species in this zone, P. rubescens was not negatively affected by altered temporal or spatial stratification patterns during its phase of net growth (July\u2013September), as the zone of its optimal light-dependent buoyancy was still located within the metalimnion. The biomass of P. rubescens in August was even significantly related to increasing temperatures. Nevertheless, a further depression of the metalimnetic top boundary may eventually restrict P. rubescens by forcing it into layers of unfavourable light conditions or into the turbulent epilimnetic zone.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/133840","SDG":13}

Many studies provide empirical estimates of such temperature dependencies, but a thorough investigation of the methods used to infer them has not been performed yet. We created artificial population time series using a stochastic logistic model parameterized with the Arrhenius equation, so that activation energy drives the temperature dependence of population parameters. We simulated different experimental designs and used different inference methods, varying the likelihood functions and other aspects of the parameter estimation methods. Finally, we applied the best performing inference methods to real data for the species Paramecium caudatum. The relative error of the estimates of activation energy varied between 5% and 30%. The fraction of habitat sampled played the most important role in determining the relative error; sampling at least 1% of the habitat kept it below 50%. We found that methods that simultaneously use all time series data (direct methods) and methods that estimate population parameters separately for each temperature (indirect methods) are complementary. Indirect methods provide a clearer insight into the shape of the functional form describing the temperature dependence of population parameters; direct methods enable a more accurate estimation of the parameters of such functional forms. Using both methods, we found that growth rate and carrying capacity of Paramecium caudatum scale with temperature according to different activation energies. Our study shows how careful choice of experimental design and inference methods can increase the accuracy of the inferred relationships between temperature and population parameters. The comparison of estimation methods provided here can increase the accuracy of model predictions, with important implications in understanding and predicting the effects of temperature on the dynamics of populations.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/104443","SDG":13}

Ciliate assemblages play a significant role in the microbial food web. The effects of environmental temperature on assemblage composition may be influenced by abiotic factors such as seasonality and disturbance, but the effects of temperature on ciliate assemblages found on different substrata have not been explored. Sandy bottoms and submerged rocks harbour dissimilar ciliate assemblages, and it might be expected that their ciliate assemblages will respond differently to temperature.\r\n2. We studied how alpha diversity, beta diversity and total biomass of ciliate protist assemblages found on sandy bottoms and submerged rocks differed in 13 geothermally heated streams in Iceland whose mean temperatures range from 5 to 20 \u00b0C. We recorded number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and measured the size of cells in ciliate assemblages from both substrata.\r\n3. Effects of temperature on natural ciliate assemblages were substratum dependent. On rock surfaces, both total ciliate biomass and alpha diversity declined with increasing temperature, and beta diversity increased with increasing temperature difference due to OTU nestedness (assemblages from warm streams being composed chiefly of subsets of the OTUs found in colder streams). In sandy substrata, however, ciliate assemblage composition was independent of temperature.\r\n4. Substratum-specific responses may be due to differences in mechanical disturbance, nutrient availability or exposure to invertebrate grazers. Rock-surface assemblages may be more exposed to the flow and retain less nutrient than those of sandy substratum; thus, they may be more strongly resource limited and more responsive to direct effects of temperature on metabolism. Alternatively, rock-surface assemblages may be more exposed to grazing by invertebrates, which intensifies with temperature.\r\n5. Our study highlights the need to account for environmental context such as substratum type to fully understand the effect of temperature on microbial assemblages in streams. Future increases in global temperatures may affect fresh waters differently depending on their prevalent substratum. Those dominated by hard substrata may have their ciliate assemblages, and thus, food-web structures and ecosystem functioning more strongly affected by warming relative to systems dominated by soft substrata.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/110487","SDG":13}

Most studies address only isolated causes within a single group of organisms; however, biological groups of different trophic levels may respond in particular ways to different environmental impacts. Our study used natural microcosms to investigate the predicted individual and interactive effects of warming, changes in top predator diversity, and habitat size on the alpha and beta diversity of macrofauna, microfauna, and bacteria. Alpha diversity (i.e., richness within each bromeliad) generally explained a larger proportion of the gamma diversity (partitioned in alpha and beta diversity). Overall, dissimilarity between communities occurred due to species turnover and not species loss (nestedness). Nevertheless, the three biological groups responded differently to each environmental stressor. Microfauna were the most sensitive group, with alpha and beta diversity being affected by environmental changes (warming and habitat size) and trophic structure (diversity of top predators). Macrofauna alpha and beta diversity was sensitive to changes in predator diversity and habitat size, but not warming. In contrast, the bacterial community was not influenced by the treatments. The community of each biological group was not mutually concordant with the environmental and trophic changes. Our results demonstrate that distinct anthropogenic impacts differentially affect the components of macro and microorganism diversity through direct and indirect effects (i.e., bottom\u2010up and top\u2010down effects). Therefore, a multitrophic and multispecies approach is necessary to assess the effects of different anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/164936","SDG":13}

However, cross\u2010scale investigation of their combined effects by linking theory and experiments is lacking. We collected data from aquatic microbial ecosystems investigating the interactive effects of warming (constant and rising temperatures) and enrichment across levels of organisation and contrasted them with community models based on metabolic theory. We found high agreement between our observations and theoretical predictions: we observed in many cases the predicted antagonistic effects of high temperature and high enrichment across levels of organisation. Temporal stability of total biomass decreased with warming but did not differ across enrichment levels. Constant and rising temperature treatments with identical mean temperature did not show qualitative differences. Overall, we conclude that model and empirical results are in broad agreement due to robustness of the effects of temperature and enrichment, that the mitigating effects of temperature on effects of enrichment may be common, and that models based on metabolic theory provide qualitatively robust predictions of the combined ecological effects of enrichment and temperature.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/170547","SDG":0}

Here, we focused on the molecular effects of the cyanobacterial oligopeptide cyanopeptolin CP1020, produced by Microcystis and Planktothrix strains, by means of whole-genome transcriptomics. Exposure of 72 hpf old zebrafish embryos for 96 h to 100 and 1,000 \u03bcg\/L CP1020 resulted in differential transcriptional alteration of 396 and 490 transcripts (fold change \u2265 2), respectively, of which 68 gene transcripts were common. These belong to genes related to various important biological and physiological pathways. Most clearly affected were pathways related to DNA damage recognition and repair, circadian rhythm and response to light. Validation by RT-qPCR showed dose-dependent transcriptional alterations of genes belonging to DNA damage and repair and regulation of circadian rhythm. This leads to the hypothesis that CP1020 acts on DNA and has neurotoxic activity. This transcriptome analysis leads to the identification of novel and unknown molecular effects of this cyanobacterial toxin, including neurotoxicity, which may have important consequences for humans consuming contaminated drinking water.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/106906","SDG":0}

We resurrected 14 clonal lineages from resting eggs extracted from three distinct sediment layers\u2014representing periods of high, medium and low copper pollution\u2014of a previously contaminated lake (Lake Orta, Italy). We exposed the resurrected clones to four copper concentrations over 14 days and recorded population densities at 48 h intervals. If the original populations in Lake Orta had adapted to the changing pollution levels, we expected to find demographic evidence of this adaptation in the resurrected lineages. However, we found high clonal variation in population-growth dynamics, which was more pronounced within than between pollution periods. Moreover, intrinsic population growth rates (r) increased chronologically. As such, the results did not reveal signs of adaptive evolution. Furthermore, we found that lineages from the period of medium copper pollution invested less into sexual reproduction than lineages from the other periods.

Integration of these subsidies depends on diversity of both terrestrial resources and aquatic shredder and decomposer communities, but the diversity effects on leaf litter breakdown and decomposition are less clear in aquatic than terrestrial ecosystems. We need a better understanding of this relationship because aquatic communities are rapidly changing with species invasions and anthropogenic impacts. Here, we experimentally disentangled the effects of leaf and shredder richness on leaf litter breakdown by macroinvertebrates in mesocosm experiments using three species of amphipods, a dominant guild of crustaceans in European freshwater ecosystems. Increased leaf richness led to lower-than-predicted leaf consumption by native shredders, with mixed evidence of resource-switching or prioritization of preferred food items within a leaf mix. Higher shredder species richness never promoted leaf consumption rates compared to predictions from relevant single-species experiments, and instead sometimes substantially decreased leaf consumption. We then conducted a meta-analysis of leaf litter consumption rates by seven widely distributed amphipod species (the three used in the experiments and four additional species). As expected based on our own experiments, nonnative amphipod species generally had lower biomass- adjusted leaf litter consumption rates, although their larger body size led to higher per-individual leaf consumption rates. Contamination of the water by metals, pesticides, and other chemicals additionally significantly decreased leaf litter consumption by multiple native and nonnative species compared to unpolluted systems. While the meta-analysis suggested that litter consumption, and thus breakdown, would decline if native shredders are replaced by nonnative heterospecifics, complete species replacement is not the only outcome following immigration in a meta-community context. Our experiments suggest that breakdown rates could remain reasonably high where native species coexist with nonnative arrivals. Experiments that neglect the ecological realism of species coexistence will necessarily mischaracterize effects on ecosystem functioning.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/153774","SDG":0}

Recent advances in environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding allow to identify prokaryotes and eukaryotes in one sequencing run, and could thus allow unprecedented resolution.

When they are shed by the female, they sink to the lake bottom, where they may become embedded in the sediment and may remain viable for decades. Extracting and hatching ephippia in the laboratory and subjecting resurrected lineages to conditions representative of historic lake environments allows retrospective investigation of life-history responses to environmental change. Here we reanalyse data from such a resurrection experiment (Piscia et al., 2015: Bull. Environ. Contam. Toxicol. 94:46\u201351). Contemporary and past lineages of Daphnia galeata Sars 1863 were obtained from Lake Orta (Italy), a deep, subalpine lake with a well-documented history of industrial copper pollution. Experimental Daphnia were subjected to three copper treatments representative of two levels of historic as well as to current (i.e., unpolluted) lake conditions, and life-table data were collected. With these data at hand, we first estimated vital rates (survival, maturation, and reproduction) and used these rates to project the asymptotic population growth rates (\u03bb) for each population-by-treatment combination. Next, we performed a retrospective decomposition to estimate the contributions of the vital rates to observed differences in \u03bb. Finally, we used elasticity analysis to explore the functional relationship between \u03bb and each of the vital rates. We found that survival rates were only compromised at elevated copper levels. Moreover, past, resurrected Daphnia had a higher \u03bb at low copper concentrations compared to unpolluted conditions, but a lower \u03bb when exposed to high copper levels. Contemporary Daphnia, on the other hand, only reproduced successfully in unpolluted water. Under these conditions, however, they had a higher population growth rate than the past Daphnia, suggesting a cost of copper tolerance in the latter. This cost was mainly due to a lower probability of reproduction and reduced fecundity, whereas survival rates contributed only little to differences in \u03bb.

This suggests that any change in the environment that will affect survival rather than reproductive parameters will have a much larger impact on Lake Orta\u2019s current Daphnia population.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/123721","SDG":0}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:164938","TITLE":"Evolution increases ecosystem temporal stability and recovery from a flood in grassland communities","ABSTRACT":"Understanding factors that increase ecosystem stability is critical in the face of environmental change. Biodiversity plays a key role in buffering ecosystems against disturbances such as extreme climatic events. The evolution of biological communities within their local environment may also increase ecosystem stability and resilience, but this has yet to be tested. Here, we provide evidence for such evolutionary effects using a long-term grassland biodiversity experiment. Communities of plants with a history of co-occurrence (co-selected communities) were temporally more stable at low diversity than the same communities of plants with no such history (na\u00efve communities). Furthermore, co-selected communities exhibited greater recovery following a major flood, resulting in more stable post-flood productivity. These results demonstrate that community evolution can increase ecosystem stability under normal circumstances and in response to extreme disturbance, but also suggest that high diversity can in part compensate for evolutionary na\u00efvety.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/164938","SDG":15}

In contrast, relatively little is known on the effects of unpredictable sources of food, such as carcasses discarded by hunters, on carnivore species. We evaluated the effect of elephant carcasses, mainly deriving from trophy hunting, on the ranging and feeding behavior of spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Using data from hyenas monitored before and during carcass availability via GPS radio-collars and camera traps, we investigated changes in ranging and feeding behavior over time. Carcass availability influenced hyenas\u2019 ranging behavior for an average of 10\u201312 days, after which their movements returned to patterns observed before carcass availability. In particular, we observed an increased spatial clustering of locations and reduced speeds (up to 15% less) between successive locations with carcass availability. Consistent feeding at carcasses during the first two weeks was typical, and some individuals fed from elephant carcasses for as long as 50 days. The impact and conservation value of hunting are often assessed based solely on the effects on the hunted species. Our results show that hunting remains can influence other species and suggest that such extra food could have important effects on critical life history processes and ultimately population dynamics. We recommend conservationists and wildlife managers evaluate management strategies and hunting practices regarding carcass disposal in order to incorporate the potential collateral impacts of hunting on non-hunted species in the same community.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/117887","SDG":15}

Imperfect species detection may result in unreliable trend estimates because this may lead to the overestimation of declines. Because many management decisions are based on population trend estimates, such biases could have severe consequences for conservation policy. We used an occupancy-modeling framework to estimate detectability and calculate nationwide population trends for 14 Swiss amphibian species both accounting for and ignoring imperfect detection. Through the application of International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List criteria to the different trend estimates, we assessed whether ignoring imperfect detection could affect conservation policy. Imperfect detection occurred for all species and detection varied substantially among species, which led to the overestimation of population declines when detectability was ignored. Consequently, accounting for imperfect detection lowered the red-list risk category for 5 of the 14 species assessed. We demonstrate that failing to consider species detectability can have serious consequences for species management and that occupancy modeling provides a flexible framework to account for observation bias and improve assessments of conservation status. A problem inherent to most historical records is that they contain presence-only data from which only relative declines can be estimated. A move toward the routine recording of nonobservation and absence data is essential if conservation practitioners are to move beyond this toward accurate population trend estimation.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/124336","SDG":15}

Although structural size and body mass result from different genetic, physiological, and ecological mechanisms, they are used interchangeably in studies evaluating population responses to environmental change. Using a 22-year (1991-2013) dataset including 1768 individuals, we investigated the coupled dynamics of size and mass in a hibernating mammal, the Alpine marmot (Marmota marmota), in response to local environmental conditions. We (i) quantified temporal trends in both traits, (ii) determined the environmental drivers of trait dynamics, and (iii) identified the life-history processes underlying the observed changes. Both phenotypic traits were followed through life: we focused on the initial trait value (juvenile size and mass) and later-life development (annual change in size [\u0394size] and mass [\u0394mass]). First, we demonstrated contrasting dynamics between size and mass over the study period. Juvenile size and subsequent \u0394size showed significant declines, whereas juvenile mass and subsequent \u0394mass remained constant. As a consequence of smaller size associated with a similar mass, individuals were in better condition in recent years. Second, size and mass showed different sensitivities to environmental variables. Both traits benefited from early access to resources in spring, whereas \u0394mass, particularly in early life, also responded to summer and winter conditions. Third, the interannual variation in both traits was caused by changes in early life development. Our study supports the importance of considering the differences between size and mass responses to the environment when evaluating the mechanisms underlying population dynamics. The current practice of focusing on only one trait in population modeling can lead to misleading conclusions when evaluating species' resilience to contemporary climate change.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/148142","SDG":15}

We argue that the procurement mode is plausibly exogenous, and show that auctions deliver stronger rail service growth than negotiations. Instrumenting rail service growth with procurement mode, we find that increasing rail service by 10% reduces carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide pollution by around 1% and 2%, respectively. Sulfur dioxide and ozone, pollutants with no clear link to rail, are not affected. Expanding rail service reduces car and motorcycle use, especially on leisure and shopping trips. The effects of railway services on car and motorcycle use and on air pollution build up over time.

Such inter-individual behavioral variations, if unaccounted for, can lead to biases in our understanding of species\u2019 feeding habits, movement pattern, and habitat selection. We tracked the movements of 16 adult brown bears in a small and isolated population in northeast Turkey to i) identify inter-individual behavioral variations associated with the use of a garbage dump and ii) to examine how these variations influenced ranging patterns, movements behavior and habitat selection.\r\nWe identified two remarkably distinct behavioral types: bears that regularly visited the dump and remained sedentary year-round, and bears that never visited the dump and migrated 165.7 \u00b1 20.1 km (round-trip mean cumulative distance \u00b1 SE) prior to hibernation to search for food. We demonstrated that during migratory trips, bears moved more rapidly and were less selective in habitat choice than during the sedentary phase; during the migration phase forest cover was the only important environmental characteristic. Our results thus reinforce the growing evidence that animals\u2019 use of the landscape largely changes according to movement phase. Our study shows that anthropogenic food resources can influence food habits, which can have cascading effects on movement patterns and hence habitat selection, ultimately resulting in the establishment of distinct behavioral types within a population. Identification and consideration of these behavioral types is thus fundamental for the correct implementation of evidence-based conservation strategies at the population level.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/124337","SDG":15}

Addressing this challenge is difficult because environmental change can generate both population-level plastic and evolutionary responses, with plastic responses being either adaptive or nonadaptive. We develop an approach that links quantitative genetic theory with data-driven structured models to allow prediction of population responses to environmental change via plasticity and adaptive evolution. After introducing general new theory, we construct a number of example models to demonstrate that evolutionary responses to environmental change over the short-term will be considerably slower than plastic responses and that the rate of adaptive evolution to a new environment depends on whether plastic responses are adaptive or nonadaptive. Parameterization of the models we develop requires information on genetic and phenotypic variation and demography that will not always be available, meaning that simpler models will often be required to predict responses to environmental change. We consequently develop a method to examine whether the full machinery of the evolutionarily explicit models we develop will be needed to predict responses to environmental change or whether simpler nonevolutionary models that are now widely constructed may be sufficient.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/148136","SDG":15}

We investigated how changes in seasonal rainfall and temperature influence vital rates and viability of an arid environment specialist, the Kalahari meerkat, through effects on body mass. We show that climate change\u2013induced reduction in adult mass in the prebreeding season would decrease fecundity during the breeding season and increase extinction risk, particularly at low population densities. In contrast, a warmer nonbreeding season resulting in increased mass and survival would buffer negative effects of reduced rainfall during the breeding season, ensuring persistence.

We use matrix population models from 454 plant and animal populations to simulate stochastic population growth rates (log \u03bbs) under different temporal autocorrelations in demographic rates, using simulated and observed covariation among rates. We then test for differences in sensitivities, or changes of log \u03bbs to changes in autocorrelation among two major axes of life-history strategies, obtained from phylogenetically informed principal component analysis: the fast-slow and reproductive-strategy continua. Fast life histories exhibit highest sensitivities to simulated autocorrelation in demographic rates across reproductive strategies. Slow life histories are less sensitive to temporal autocorrelation, but their sensitivities increase among highly iteroparous species. We provide cross-taxonomic evidence that changes in the autocorrelation of environmental variation may affect a wide range of species, depending on complex interactions of life-history strategies.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/147801","SDG":15}

Predicting the effects of environmental change on wildlife populations therefore requires a thorough understanding of the mechanisms through which different environmental drivers interact to generate changes in population size and structure.\r\n    In this study, we disentangled the roles of temperature, food availability and population density in shaping short\u2010 and long\u2010term population dynamics of the African striped mouse, a small rodent inhabiting a semidesert with high intra\u2010 and interannual variation in environmental conditions.\r\n    We parameterized a female\u2010only stage\u2010structured matrix population model with vital rates depending on temperature, food availability and population density, using monthly mark\u2013recapture data from 1609 mice trapped over 9 years (2005\u20132014). We then applied perturbation analyses to determine relative strengths and demographic pathways of these drivers in affecting population dynamics. Furthermore, we used stochastic population projections to gain insights into how three different climate change scenarios might affect size, structure and persistence of this population.\r\n    We identified food availability, acting through reproduction, as the main driver of changes in both short\u2010 and long\u2010term population dynamics. This mechanism was mediated by strong density feedbacks, which stabilized the population after high peaks and allowed it to recover from detrimental crashes. Density dependence thus buffered the population against environmental change, and even adverse climate change scenarios were predicted to have little effect on population persistence (extinction risk over 100 years <5%) despite leading to overall lower abundances.\r\n    Explicitly linking environment\u2013demography relationships to population dynamics allowed us to accurately capture past population dynamics. It further enabled establishing the roles and relative importances of extrinsic and intrinsic environmental drivers, and we conclude that doing this is essential when investigating impacts of climate change on wildlife populations.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/168420","SDG":15}

Here we address recent developments in foraging and habitat selection, source\u2013sink dynamics, competition (both within and between species), population cycles, predation (including apparent competition), mutualism, and biological invasions. Because mammals are appealing to the public, ecological insight gleaned from the study of mammals has disproportionate potential in educating the public about ecological principles and their application to wise management. Mammals have been central to many computational and statistical developments in recent years, including refinements to traditional approaches and metrics (e.g., capture-recapture) as well as advancements of novel and developing fields (e.g., spatial capture-recapture, occupancy modeling, integrated population models). The study of mammals also poses challenges in terms of fully characterizing dynamics in natural conditions. Ongoing climate change threatens to affect global ecosystems, and mammals provide visible and charismatic subjects for research on local and regional effects of such change as well as predictive modeling of the long-term effects on ecosystem function and stability.

This shift offers opportunities for a deeper mechanistic understanding of the role of biodiversity in maintaining multiple ecosystem processes and services. In this paper, we highlight studies that have focused on BEF of microbial communities with an emphasis on integrating trait-based approaches to microbial ecology. In doing so, we explore some of the inherent challenges and opportunities of understanding BEF using microbial systems. For example, microbial biologists characterize communities using gene phylogenies that are often unable to resolve functional traits. Additionally, experimental designs of existing microbial BEF studies are often inadequate to unravel BEF relationships. We argue that combining eco-physiological studies with contemporary molecular tools in a trait-based framework can reinforce our ability to link microbial diversity to ecosystem processes. We conclude that such trait-based approaches are a promising framework to increase the understanding of microbial BEF relationships and thus generating systematic principles in microbial ecology and more generally ecology.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/107535","SDG":0}

The establishment of tree diversity experiments poses specific methodological challenges for assessing the multiple functions provided by forest ecosystems. In particular, methodological inconsistencies and nonstandardized protocols impede the analysis of multifunctionality within, and comparability across the increasing number of tree diversity experiments. By providing an overview on key methods currently applied in one of the largest forest biodiversity experiments, we show how methods differing in scale and simplicity can be combined to retrieve consistent data allowing novel insights into forest ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, we discuss and develop recommendations for the integration and transferability of diverse methodical approaches to present and future forest biodiversity experiments. We identified four principles that should guide basic decisions concerning method selection for tree diversity experiments and forest BEF research: (1) method selection should be directed toward maximizing data density to increase the number of measured variables in each plot. (2) Methods should cover all relevant scales of the experiment to consider scale dependencies of biodiversity effects. (3) The same variable should be evaluated with the same method across space and time for adequate larger-scale and longer-time data analysis and to reduce errors due to changing measurement protocols. (4) Standardized, practical and rapid methods for assessing biodiversity and ecosystem functions should be promoted to increase comparability among forest BEF experiments. We demonstrate that currently available methods provide us with a sophisticated toolbox to improve a synergistic understanding of forest multifunctionality. However, these methods require further adjustment to the specific requirements of structurally complex and long-lived forest ecosystems. By applying methods connecting relevant scales, trophic levels, and above- and belowground ecosystem compartments, knowledge gain from large tree diversity experiments can be optimized.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/145143","SDG":15}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:126029","TITLE":"Biodiversity increases the resistance of ecosystem productivity to climate extremes","ABSTRACT":"It remains unclear whether biodiversity buffers ecosystems against climate extremes, which are becoming increasingly frequent worldwide1. Early results suggested that the ecosystem productivity of diverse grassland plant communities was more resistant, changing less during drought, and more resilient, recovering more quickly after drought, than that of depauperate communities2. However, subsequent experimental tests produced mixed results3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Here we use data from 46 experiments that manipulated grassland plant diversity to test whether biodiversity provides resistance during and resilience after climate events. We show that biodiversity increased ecosystem resistance for a broad range of climate events, including wet or dry, moderate or extreme, and brief or prolonged events. Across all studies and climate events, the productivity of low-diversity communities with one or two species changed by approximately 50% during climate events, whereas that of high-diversity communities with 16\u201332 species was more resistant, changing by only approximately 25%. By a year after each climate event, ecosystem productivity had often fully recovered, or overshot, normal levels of productivity in both high- and low-diversity communities, leading to no detectable dependence of ecosystem resilience on biodiversity. Our results suggest that biodiversity mainly stabilizes ecosystem productivity, and productivity-dependent ecosystem services, by increasing resistance to climate events. Anthropogenic environmental changes that drive biodiversity loss thus seem likely to decrease ecosystem stability14, and restoration of biodiversity to increase it, mainly by changing the resistance of ecosystem productivity to climate events.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/126029","SDG":13}

So far, these links have mainly been studied in grasslands or in artificial tree plantations with low species richness. Furthermore, most studies provide results from newly established experimental plant communities where trophic links are not fully established or from stands of tree saplings that have not yet developed a canopy. Here, we test how tree diversity in a species-rich subtropical forest in China with fully developed tree canopy affects levels of herbivore damage caused by different arthropod feeding guilds. Methods We established 27 plots of 30\u00d730 m area. The plots were selected randomly but with the constraint that they had to span a large range of tree diversity as required for comparative studies in contrast to sample surveys. We recorded herbivore damage caused by arthropod feeding guilds (leaf chewers, leaf skeletonizers and sap feeders) on canopy leaves of all major tree species. Important Findings Levels of herbivore damage increased with tree species richness and tree phylogenetic diversity. These effects were most pronounced for damage caused by leaf chewers. Although the two diversity measures were highly correlated, we additionally found a significant interaction between them, whereby species richness increased herbivory mostly at low levels of phylogenetic diversity. Tree species with the lowest proportion of canopy leaf biomass in a plot tended to suffer the highest levels of herbivore damage, which is in contrast to expectations based on the resource concentration hypothesis. Our results are in agreement with expectations of the dietary mixing hypothesis where generalist herbivores with a broad spectrum of food plants benefit from increased resource diversity in tree species-rich forest patches.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/145124","SDG":0}

In addition, we surveyed the literature to review the effect of body mass on core body temperature range in relation to environmental temperature in the Testudinidae. Diurnal activity of tortoises was bimodally distributed and influenced by environmental temperature and season. The mean air temperature at which activity is maximized was 27.9\u00b0C, with a range of 25.8\u201331.7\u00b0C. Furthermore, air temperature explained changes in the core body temperature better than did mass, and only during the coldest trial, did tortoises with higher mass show more stable temperatures. Our results, together with the overall Testudinidae overview, suggest that, once variation in environmental temperature has been taken into account, there is little effect of mass on the temperature stability of tortoises. Moreover, the presence of thermal inertia in an individual tortoise depends on the environmental temperatures, and we found no evidence for inertial homeothermy. Finally, patterns of core and external body temperatures in comparison with environmental temperatures suggest that Aldabra giant tortoises act as mixed conformer\u2013regulators.

The method does not require prior taxonomic information and integrates variation in plant functional traits between and within plant species. We compare our method with leaf-level field measurements and species-level plot inventory data and find reasonable agreement. Morphological and physiological diversity show consistent change with topography and soil, with low functional richness at a mountain ridge under specific environmental conditions. Overall, functional richness follows a logarithmic increase with area, whereas divergence and evenness are scale invariant. By mapping diversity at scales of individual trees to whole communities we demonstrate the potential of assessing functional diversity from space, providing a pathway only limited by technological advances and not by methodology.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/142724","SDG":15}

Soil samples of different depth increments and data on tree height were collected from a total of 566 plots (667 m2 each). The soils were analyzed for carbon (soil organic carbon [SOC]), nitrogen, acidity, cation exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable cations and base saturation as soil fertility attributes. All plots were classified into geomorphological units. Analyses of variance and linear regressions were applied to all terrain, soil fertility and tree growth attributes.\r\nImportant Findings: In general, young and shallow soils and relatively small differences in stable soil properties suggest that soil erosion has truncated the soils to a large extent over the whole area of the experiment. This explains the concurrently increasing CEC and SOC stocks downslope, in hollows and in valleys. However, colluvial, carbon-rich sediments are missing widely due to the convexity of the footslopes caused by uplift and removal of eroded sediments by adjacent waterways. The results showed that soil fertility is mainly influenced by topography. Monte\u2013Carlo flow accumulation (MCCA), curvature, slope and aspect significantly affected soil fertility. Furthermore, soil fertility was affected by the different geomorphological positions on the experimental sites with ridge and spur positions showing lower exchangeable base cation contents, especially potassium (K), due to leaching. This geomorphological effect of soil fertility is most pronounced in the topsoil and decreases when considering the subsoil down to 50cm depth. Few soil fertility attributes affect tree height after 1\u20132 years of growth, among which C stocks proved to be most important while pHKCl and CEC only played minor roles. Nevertheless, soil acidity and a high proportion of Al on the exchange complex affected tree height even after only 1\u20132 years growth. Hence, our study showed that forest nutrition is coupled to a recycling of litter nutrients, and does not only depend on subsequent supply of nutrients from the mineral soil. Besides soil fertility, topography affected tree height. We found that especially MCCA as indicator of water availability affected tree growth at small-scale, as well as aspect. Overall, our synthesis on the interrelation between fertility, topography and tree growth in a subtropical forest ecosystem in SE China showed that topographic heterogeneity lead to ecological gradients across geomorphological positions. In this respect, small-scale soil\u2013plant interactions in a young forest can serve as a driver for the future development of vegetation and biodiversity control on soil fertility. In addition, it shows that terrain attributes should be accounted for in ecological research.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/145140","SDG":15}

On the one hand, it will review a group of blog cartoons reacting to a recent environmental hazard, the Huangpu River floating pigs incident, which were published beginning from mid-March 2013. On the other hand, it looks at intellectual responses to a political economy of short-term profit extraction whose negative impact far exceeds the destruction of the nation's landscapes. Selective readings of lower rungs fiction (diceng wenxue), landscape poetry and multi-media art, and theoretical essays on questions of landscape aesthetics will discuss how these authors express their worries about the consequences of a narrowly functional approach towards natural resources. According to them, the foreclosing of  traditional aesthetic principles that used to support sustainability in modern modes of governance has yielded an unprecedented moral decline of the community as well as an alarming depletion of the nation's non-human recreational powers. In conclusion, five kinds of environmental subjects will tentatively be identified together with their different patterns of agency.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/98340","SDG":15}

In this study we compared ecosystem services provision of agroforestry and non-agroforestry landscapes in case study regions from three European biogeographical regions: Mediterranean (montado and dehesa), Continental (orchards and wooded pasture) and Atlantic agroforestry systems (chestnut soutos and hedgerows systems). Seven ecosystem service indicators (two provisioning and five regulating services) were mapped, modelled and assessed. Clear variations in amount and provision of ecosystem services were found between different types of agroforestry systems. Nonetheless regulating ecosystems services were improved in all agroforestry landscapes, with reduced nitrate losses, higher carbon sequestration, reduced soil losses, higher functional biodiversity focussed on pollination and greater habitat diversity reflected in a high proportion of semi-natural habitats. The results for provisioning services were inconsistent. While the annual biomass yield and the groundwater recharge rate tended to be higher in agricultural landscapes without agroforestry systems, the total biomass stock was reduced. These broad relationships were observed within and across the case study regions regardless of the agroforestry type or biogeographical region. Overall our study underlines the positive influence of agroforestry systems on the supply of regulating services and their role to enhance landscape structure.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/145163","SDG":15}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:167215","TITLE":"High mutation rates limit evolutionary adaptation in Escherichia coli","ABSTRACT":"Mutation is fundamental to evolution, because it generates the genetic variation on which selection can act. In nature, genetic changes often increase the mutation rate in systems that range from viruses and bacteria to human tumors. Such an increase promotes the accumulation of frequent deleterious or neutral alleles, but it can also increase the chances that a population acquires rare beneficial alleles. Here, we study how up to 100-fold increases in Escherichia coli\u2019s genomic mutation rate affect adaptive evolution. To do so, we evolved multiple replicate populations of asexual E. coli strains engineered to have four different mutation rates for 3000 generations in the laboratory. We measured the ability of evolved populations to grow in their original environment and in more than 90 novel chemical environments. In addition, we subjected the populations to whole genome population sequencing. Although populations with higher mutation rates accumulated greater genetic diversity, this diversity conveyed benefits only for modestly increased mutation rates, where populations adapted faster and also thrived better than their ancestors in some novel environments. In contrast, some populations at the highest mutation rates showed reduced adaptation during evolution, and failed to thrive in all of the 90 alternative environments. In addition, they experienced a dramatic decrease in mutation rate. Our work demonstrates that the mutation rate changes the global balance between deleterious and beneficial mutational effects on fitness. In contrast to most theoretical models, our experiments suggest that this tipping point already occurs at the modest mutation rates that are found in the wild.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/167215","SDG":0}

We investigated genomic divergence in Metrosideros polymorpha, a woody species that occupies a wide range of ecological habitats across the Hawaiian Islands and shows remarkable phenotypic variation. Using 1659 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers annotated with the genome assembly, we examined the population genetic structure and demographic history of nine populations across five elevations and two ages of substrates on Mauna Loa, the island of Hawaii. The nine populations were differentiated into two genetic clusters distributed on the lower and higher elevations and were largely admixed on the middle elevation. Demographic modelling revealed that the two genetic clusters have been maintained in the face of gene flow, and the effective population size of the high-altitude cluster was much smaller. A FST -based outlier search among the 1659 SNPs revealed that 34 SNPs (2.05%) were likely to be under divergent selection and the allele frequencies of 21 of them were associated with environmental changes along elevations, such as temperature and precipitation. This study shows a genomic mosaic of M. polymorpha, in which contrasting divergence patterns were found. While most genomic polymorphisms were shared among populations, a small fraction of the genome was significantly differentiated between populations in diverse environments and could be responsible for the dramatic adaptation to a wide range of environments.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/134699","SDG":0}

The broad European and Asian distribution and heavy metal hyperaccumulation ability makes A. halleri a useful model for ecological genomics studies.We used long-insert mate-pair libraries to improve the genome assembly of the A. halleri ssp.gemmifera Tada mine genotype (W302) collected from a site with high contamination by heavy metals in Japan. After five rounds of forced selfing, heterozygosity was reduced to 0.04%, which facilitated subsequent genome assembly. Our assembly now covers 196 Mb or 78% of the estimated genome size and achieved scaffold N50 length of 712 kb. To validate assembly and annotation, we used synteny of A. halleri Tada mine with a previously published high quality reference assembly of a closely related species, Arabidopsis lyrata. Further validation of the assembly quality comes from synteny and phylogenetic analysis of the HEAVY METAL ATPASE4 (HMA4) and METAL TOLERANCE PROTEIN1 (MTP1) regions using published sequences from European A. halleri for comparison. Three tandemly duplicated copies of HMA4, key gene involved in cadmium and zinc hyperaccumulation, were assembled on a single scaffold.The assembly will enhance the genome-wide studies of A. halleri as well as the allopolyploid Arabidopsis kamchatica derived from A. lyrata and A. halleri.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/126774","SDG":0}

However, little is known about their effects on genetic diversity within species.\r\nAims: We assess the degree of genetic diversity among dipterocarp seedlings used for enrichment planting of selectively logged forests in Sabah, Malaysia, and compare it with diversity in naturally regenerating seedlings.\r\nMethods: We sampled young leaf tissues from seedlings of Shorea leprosula and Parashorea malaanonan for DNA genotyping, using microsatellite markers.\r\nResults: The levels of genetic diversity (expected heterozygosity and rarefied allelic richness) of naturally regenerating seedlings were statistically indistinguishable among unlogged, once logged and repeatedly logged forest areas. Enrichment-planted seedlings of P. malaanonan exhibited similar levels of genetic diversity to naturally regenerating seedlings whereas those of S. leprosula had significantly lower genetic diversity than natural seedlings. Interestingly, reduction of genetic variation was consistently observed in single-species plots relative to mixed-species plots among enrichment-planted seedlings.\r\nConclusions: There was no reduction of genetic variation in naturally regenerating dipterocarp seedlings in areas of selective logging. However, genetic variation of enrichment-planted seedlings was lower in single-species plots relative to mixed-species plots. This suggests that enrichment-planting strategies should adopt diverse mixtures that should promote levels of both species richness and genetic diversity within species.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/134672","SDG":15}

However, it has rarely been tested whether such estimates are useful proxies for genome-wide\r\npatterns of variation and differentiation. Here, we compared microsatellite variation with genome-wide single\r\nnucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to assess and quantify potential marker-specific biases and derive recommendations for future studies. Overall, we genotyped 180 Arabidopsis halleri individuals from nine populations using 20 microsatellite markers. Twelve of these markers were originally developed for Arabidopsis thaliana (cross-species markers) and eight for A. halleri (species-specific markers). We further characterized 2 million SNPs across the genome with a pooled whole-genome re-sequencing approach (Pool-Seq). \r\nResults: Our analyses revealed that estimates of genetic diversity and differentiation derived from cross-species and\r\nspecies-specific microsatellites differed substantially and that expected microsatellite heterozygosity (SSR-He) was not significantly correlated with genome-wide SNP diversity estimates (SNP-He and \u03b8Watterson) in A. halleri. Instead, microsatellite allelic richness (Ar) was a better proxy for genome-wide SNP diversity. Estimates of genetic differentiation among populations (FST) based on both marker types were correlated, but microsatellite-based estimates were significantly larger than those from SNPs. Possible causes include the limited number of microsatellite markers used, marker ascertainment bias, as well as the high varianc microsatellite-derived estimates. In contrast, genomewide SNP data provided unbiased estimates of genetic diversity independent of whether genome- or only exome-wide SNPs were used. Further, we inferred that a few thousand random SNPs are sufficient to reliably estimate genome-wide diversity and to distinguish among populations differing in genetic variation.\r\nConclusions: We recommend that future analyses of genetic diversity within and differentiation among populations\r\nuse randomly selected high-throughput sequencing-based SNP data to draw conclusions on genome-wide diversity\r\npatterns.

Theory predicts that additional insurance effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning could emerge across time and space if species respond asynchronously to environmental variation and if species become increasingly dominant when and where they are most productive. Even if only a few dominant species maintain ecosystem functioning within a particular time and place, ecosystem functioning may be enhanced by many different species across many times and places (\u03b2\u2010diversity). Here, we develop and apply a new approach to estimate these previously unquantified insurance effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning that arise due to species turnover across times and places. In a long\u2010term (18\u2010year) grassland plant diversity experiment, we find that total insurance effects are positive in sign and substantial in magnitude, amounting to 19% of the net biodiversity effect, mostly due to temporal insurance effects. Species loss can therefore reduce ecosystem functioning both locally and by eliminating species that would otherwise enhance ecosystem functioning across temporally fluctuating and spatially heterogeneous environments.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/151382","SDG":15}

Analysing subsets of functions showed that the effects of biodiversity on multifunctionality were stronger when more functions were included and that the strength of the biodiversity effects depended on the identity of the functions included. Limits to multifunctionality arose from negative correlations among functions and functions that were not correlated with biodiversity. Our findings underline that the management of ecosystems for the protection of biodiversity cannot be replaced by managing for particular ecosystem functions or services and emphasize the need for specific management to protect biodiversity. More plant species from the experimental pool of 60 species contributed to functioning when more functions were considered.

However, an unprecedented level of anthropogenic influences is reducing the resilience and stability of our forest ecosystems as well as their ecosystem functions. The relationships between drivers, stress, and ecosystem functions in forest ecosystems are complex, multi-faceted, and often non-linear, and yet forest managers, decision makers, and politicians need to be able to make rapid decisions that are data-driven and based on short and long-term monitoring information, complex modeling, and analysis approaches. A huge number of long-standing and standardized forest health inventory approaches already exist, and are increasingly integrating remote-sensing based monitoring approaches. Unfortunately, these approaches in monitoring, data storage, analysis, prognosis, and assessment still do not satisfy the future requirements of information and digital knowledge processing of the 21st century. Therefore, this paper discusses and presents in detail five sets of requirements, including their relevance, necessity, and the possible solutions that would be necessary for establishing a feasible multi-source forest health monitoring network for the 21st century. Namely, these requirements are: (1) understanding the effects of multiple stressors on forest health; (2) using remote sensing (RS) approaches to monitor forest health; (3) coupling different monitoring approaches; (4) using data science as a bridge between complex and multidimensional big forest health (FH) data; and (5) a future multi-source forest health monitoring network. It became apparent that no existing monitoring approach, technique, model, or platform is sufficient on its own to monitor, model, forecast, or assess forest health and its resilience. In order to advance the development of a multi-source forest health monitoring network, we argue that in order to gain a better understanding of forest health in our complex world, it would be conducive to implement the concepts of data science with the components: (i) digitalization; (ii) standardization with metadata management after the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles; (iii) Semantic Web; (iv) proof, trust, and uncertainties; (v) tools for data science analysis; and (vi) easy tools for scientists, data managers, and stakeholders for decision-making support.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/157398","SDG":15}

Remote sensing approaches using sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) hold the potential to directly assess ecosystem photosynthesis. However, many challenges remain linked to using the SIF emission signal to estimate gross primary production (GPP). The goal of this study was to gain a better understanding of the relationships between GPP and SIF over different time scales (minutes to years) and under varying environmental conditions. Two different ecosystems were investigated, a cropland and a mixed forest, with continuous eddy covariance flux measurements. Continuous tower-based SIF retrievals were performed in 2015 and 2016 at both ecosystems.\r\n\r\nIn both ecosystems, SIF was found to be more affected by environmental conditions than GPP. Annual cycles for GPP and SIF differed at the mixed forest due in part to the influence of the different footprint size of the two independent measurements. Diurnal cycles in GPP and SIF corresponded well under unstressed conditions and followed the incoming photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). However, depressions in SIF were found at both sites either at midday or in the afternoon during the growing season. At the cropland site, reductions in SIF occurred at high PPFD (PPFD\u202f>\u202f1470\u202f\u03bcmol\u202fm\u22122\u202fs\u22121, R2\u202f=\u202f0.62) and high VPD (VPD\u202f>\u202f1590\u202fPa, R2\u202f=\u202f0.35). Whereas at the forest site, reductions in SIF were linked to high VPD (VPD\u202f>\u202f1250\u202fPa, R2\u202f=\u202f0.25), but not to high PPFD (R2\u202f=\u202f0.84). The depression in SIF was also associated with an increase in non-photochemical quenching, as indicated by the photochemical reflectance index (R2\u202f=\u202f0.78), thus showing the complementarity between SIF and non-photochemical quenching as different energy pathways. Our results show the importance of characterizing the influence of different environmental conditions on SIF-GPP relationships for specific ecosystems to reliably estimate GPP from remote sensing measurements.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/161329","SDG":13}

Appropriate management is a key factor in maintaining habitat quality of the remaining most valuable sites and should thus be an essential part of monitoring studies. However, information on management is often missing and fine-scale patterns are difficult to assess, especially over large areas and for past decades.\r\nThe aim of this study was to predict habitat quality of protected dry grasslands in Switzerland. Using a nation-wide in-situ vegetation data set with plot-based species lists, we derived six habitat quality indicators (management tolerance, light availability, nutrient content, moisture content and species richness). We then tested how well satellite-based phenology metrics, in combination with environmental and climate data, can predict these dry grassland habitat quality indicators. We expected that the seasonal pattern of vegetation activity, based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), would represent local productivity and management patterns, two crucial indicators of dry grassland habitat quality. Linear regression analysis was conducted to assess the relative importance and ecological relationship of different NDVI metrics and other environmental and climate predictors for habitat quality. Variance partitioning was applied to assess model contributions of the three variable groups which represent different data sources for productivity and management.\r\nAccuracies for the habitat quality prediction models ranged between 34% and 57% and significant correlations with multiple NDVI metrics were found. Including NDVI phenology improved all models by 7\u201312%. Single contributions of NDVI phenology were highest for management tolerance and nutrient content. However, we found high variation of contributions between management types. NDVI metrics were highly informative for the habitat qualities of abandoned sites, but grazing and mowing reduced or even cancelled their predictive power. Moreover, our results demonstrate the limitation of single-date NDVI values in predicting habitat quality of dry grasslands, in particular pastures and meadows. For monitoring applications of dry grasslands, we propose using a combination of NDVI metrics, as our results showed that they greatly improve prediction results of essential habitat qualities. The Landsat legacy dataset facilitates the assessment of habitat changes during past decades and can be complemented in the future with higher resolution data, such as Sentinel-2, to increase the temporal and spatial resolution so analyses are more appropriate for the typically limited size of dry grassland habitat sites in Switzerland.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/167348","SDG":15}

Observing an extinction event is rare, so in many cases extinction status is inferred using methods based on the analysis of records of historic sighting events. The accuracy of such methods is difficult to test. However, results of recent experiments with microcosm communities suggest that the rate at which a population declines to extinction, potentially driven by varying environmental conditions, may alter one's ability accurately to infer extinction status. We tested how the rate of population decline, driven by historic environmental change, alters the accuracy of 6 commonly applied sighting-based methods used to infer extinction. We used data from small-scale experimental communities and recorded wild population extirpations. We assessed how accuracy of the different methods was affected by rate of population decline, search effort, and number of sighting events recorded. Rate of population decline and historic population size of the species affected the accuracy of inferred extinction dates; however, faster declines produced more accurate inferred dates of extinction, but only when population sizes were higher. Optimal linear estimation (OLE) offered the most reliable and robust estimates, though no single method performed best in all situations, and it may be appropriate to use a different method if information regarding historic search efforts is available. OLE provided the most accurate estimates of extinction when the number of sighting events used was >10, and future use of this method should take this into account. Data from experimental populations provide added insight into testing techniques to discern wild extirpation events. Care should be taken designing such experiments so that they mirror closely the abundance dynamics of populations affected by real-world extirpation events.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/97395","SDG":15}

We manipulated small natural freshwater ecosystems to investigate how warming and top predator loss affect seven ecosystem functions representing two major dimensions of ecosystem functioning, productivity and metabolism. We investigated their direct and indirect effects on community diversity and standing stock of multitrophic macro and microorganisms. Warming directly increased multifunctional ecosystem productivity and metabolism. In contrast, top predator loss indirectly affected multifunctional ecosystem productivity via changes in the diversity of detritivorous macroinvertebrates, but did not affect ecosystem metabolism. In addition to demonstrating how multiple anthropogenic drivers have different impacts, via different pathways, on ecosystem multifunctionality components, our work should further spur advances in predicting responses of ecosystems to multiple simultaneous environmental changes.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/145891","SDG":13}

However, it remains unclear to which extent leaf litter species richness affects these processes of nutrient cycling, and whether effects on one of those processes propagate to the subsequent one. We established a common garden decomposition experiment in a Chinese subtropical secondary forest, to trace two essential nutrients during decomposition and their uptake by plants along a litter species diversity gradient. Unlabelled, and 15N and Li (as surrogate for K) labelled leaves of three native tree species were used to create replicated 1-, 2- and 3-species mixtures, each with one species labelled per mixture. Litter mixtures were placed in mesocosms with one growing herbaceous phytometer plant. Over six months, litter and phytometer plants of each mixture were sampled at four points in time and the different process steps of nutrient dynamics were determined. Our results showed species and nutrient specific decomposition dynamics, which propagated through the processes of mass loss, nutrient release and transfer among species, and nutrient uptake dynamics of phytometer plants. However, we found no litter species diversity effects along the different litter decomposition processes. Rather specific diversity effects occurred in few cases at different points in time for mass loss, Li release and transfer dynamics. These effects were not caused by nutrient transfer from labelled to unlabelled litter, suggesting that species identity effects on decomposer dynamics may outweigh effects of nutrient transfer among litter species in mixtures. Further, the observed litter species diversity effects did not affect the 15N uptake of phytometer plants. Hence, the influence of species diversity on nutrient cycling and plant available nutrient stocks is mainly determined by the amount and variety of chemical compounds that different species exhibit and release to the soil.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/149843","SDG":0}

Currently recognized global biodiversity hotspots are spatially too coarse for conservation management and identification of hotspots at a finer scale is needed. This might be achieved by identification of areas of endemism. Here, we identify areas of endemism in Iran, a major component of the Irano-Anatolian biodiversity hotspot, and address their ecological correlates. Using the extremely diverse sunflower family (Asteraceae) as our model system, five consensus areas of endemism were identified using the approach of endemicity analysis. Both endemic richness and degree of endemicity were positively related to topographic complexity and elevational range. The proportion of endemic taxa at a certain elevation (percent endemism) was not congruent with the proportion of total surface area at this elevation, but was higher in mountain ranges. While the distribution of endemic richness (i.e., number of endemic taxa) along an elevational gradient was hump-shaped peaking at mid-elevations, the percentage of endemism gradually increased with elevation. Patterns of endemic richness as well as areas of endemism identify mountain ranges as main centres of endemism, which is likely due to high environmental heterogeneity and strong geographic isolation among and within mountain ranges. The herein identified areas can form the basis for defining areas with conservation priority in this global biodiversity hotspot.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/152463","SDG":15}

We show that landscape-scale productivity and its temporal stability increase with the diversity of plants and other taxa. Effects of biodiversity indicators on productivity were comparable in size to effects of other important drivers related to climate, topography, and land cover. These effects occurred in plots that integrated different ecosystem types (i.e., metaecosystems) and were consistent over vast environmental and altitudinal gradients. The BEF relations we report are as strong or even exceed the ones found in small-scale experiments, despite different community assembly processes and a species pool comprising nearly 2,000 vascular plant species. Growing season length increased progressively over the observation period, and this shift was accelerated in more diverse plots, suggesting that a large species pool is important for adaption to climate change. Our study further implies that abiotic global-change drivers may mediate ecosystem functioning through biodiversity changes.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/142669","SDG":0}

In this study, we hypothesize that aliphatic amines, which are highly abundant among organic micropollutants, are partly removed from the water phase in activated sludge through ion trapping in protozoa. In ion trapping, which has been extensively investigated in medical research, the neutral species of amine-containing compounds diffuse through the cell membrane and further into acidic vesicles present in eukaryotic cells such as protozoa. There they become trapped because diffusion of the positively charged species formed in the acidic vesicles is strongly hindered. We tested our hypothesis with two experiments. First, we studied the distribution of the fluorescent amine acridine orange in activated sludge by confocal fluorescence imaging. We observed intense fluorescence in distinct compartments of the protozoa, but not in the bacterial biomass. Second, we investigated the distribution of 12 amine-containing and eight control micropollutants in both regular activated sludge and sludge where the protozoa had been inactivated. In contrast to most control compounds, the amine-containing micropollutants displayed a distinctly different behavior in the noninhibited sludge compared to the inhibited one: (i) more removal from the liquid phase; (ii) deviation from first-order kinetics for the removal from the liquid phase; and (iii) higher amounts in the solid phase. These results provide strong evidence that ion trapping in protozoa occurs and that it is an important removal mechanism for amine-containing micropollutants in batch experiments with activated sludge that has so far gone unnoticed. We expect that our findings will trigger further investigations on the importance of this process in full-scale wastewater treatment systems, including its relevance for accumulation of ammonium.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/143804","SDG":6}

However, half-life estimates for individual pesticides often span several orders of magnitude, reflecting the impact that various environmental or experimental parameters have on half-lives in soil. In this work, we collected literature-reported half-lives for eleven pesticides along with associated metadata describing the environmental or experimental conditions under which they were derived. We then developed a multivariable framework to discover relationships between the half-lives and associated metadata. We first compared data for the herbicide atrazine collected from 95 laboratory and 65 field studies. We discovered that atrazine application history and soil texture were the parameters that have the largest influence on the observed half-lives in both types of studies. We then extended the analysis to include ten additional pesticides with data collected exclusively from laboratory studies. We found that, when data were available, pesticide application history and biomass concentrations were always positively associated with half-lives. The relevance of other parameters varied among the pesticides, but in some cases the variability could be explained by the physicochemical properties of the pesticides. For example, we found that the relative significance of the organic carbon content of soil for determining half-lives depends on the relative solubility of the pesticide. Altogether, our analyses highlight the reciprocal influence of both environmental parameters and intrinsic physicochemical properties for determining half-lives in soil. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Improving the removal of antibiotics during wastewater treatment therefore is a prime objective of environmental engineering. Here we obtained a detailed picture of the fate of sulfonamide antibiotics during activated sludge treatment using a combination of analytical methods. We show that pterin-sulfonamide conjugates, which are formed when sulfonamides interact with their target enzyme to inhibit folic acid synthesis, represent a major biotransformation route for sulfonamides in laboratory batch experiments with activated sludge. The same major conjugates were also present in the effluents of nine Swiss wastewater treatment plants. The demonstration of this biotransformation route, which is removal. related to bacterial growth, helps explain seemingly contradictory views on optimal conditions for sulfonamide More importantly, since pterin-sulfonamide conjugates show retained antibiotic activity, our findings suggest that risk from exposure to sulfonamide antibiotics may be less reduced during wastewater treatment than previously assumed. Our results thus further emphasize the inadequacy of focusing on parent compound removal and the importance of investigating biotransformation pathways and removal of bioactivity to properly assess contaminant removal in both engineered and natural systems.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/162389","SDG":6}

Remote sensing (RS) offers a unique capability to assess ES systematically and regularly across spatial and temporal scales. We aim to evaluate the benefits of RS to monitor spatio-temporal variations of ES by assessing several ES in Switzerland between 2004 and 2014. We coupled mechanistic ES models and RS data to estimate time series of three regulating (i.e. carbon dioxide regulation (CO\u2082R), soil erosion prevention (SEP), and air quality regulation (AQR)) and one cultural ES (re- creational hiking (RH)). The resulting ES were used to assess spatial and temporal changes, trade-offs and sy- nergies of ES potential supply and flow in Switzerland between 2004 and 2014. Resulting ES trends showed diverse spatial patterns across Switzerland with largest changes in CO\u2082R and AQR. ES interactions revealed a scale and elevation dependency. We identified weak to strong synergies between all ES combinations except for trade-offs between CO\u2082R\u2013AQR and AQR\u2013RH at Swiss scale. Spatially, all ES interactions revealed a hetero- geneous mix of synergies and trade-offs within Switzerland.\r\nOur results demonstrate the strength of RS for systematic and regular spatio-temporal ES monitoring and contribute insights to the large potential of RS, which will be extended with future Earth observation missions. Derived spatially explicit ES information will facilitate decision-making in landscape planning and conservation and will allow examining progress towards environmental policies.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/150262","SDG":15}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:152153","TITLE":"Remote sensing of plant-water relations: An overview and future perspectives","ABSTRACT":"Vegetation is a highly dynamic component of the Earth surface and substantially alters the water cycle. Particularly the process of oxygenic plant photosynthesis determines vegetation connecting the water and carbon cycle and causing various interactions and feedbacks across Earth spheres. While vegetation impacts the water cycle, it reacts to changing water availability via functional, biochemical and structural responses. Unravelling the resulting complex feedbacks and interactions between the plant-water system and environmental change is essential for any modelling approaches and predictions, but still insufficiently understood due to currently missing observations. We hypothesize that an appropriate cross-scale monitoring of plant-water relations can be achieved by combined observational and modelling approaches. This paper reviews suitable remote sensing approaches to assess plant-water relations ranging from pure observational to combined observational-modelling approaches. We use a combined energy balance and radiative transfer model to assess the explanatory power of pure observational approaches focussing on plant parameters to estimate plant-water relations, followed by an outline for a more effective use of remote sensing by their integration into soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC) models. We apply a mechanistic model simulating water movement in the SPAC to reveal insight into the complexity of relations between soil, plant and atmospheric parameters, and thus plant water relations. We conclude that future research should focus on strategies combining observations and mechanistic modelling to advance our knowledge on the interplay between the plant-water system and environmental change, e.g. through plant transpiration.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/152153","SDG":0}

Armerina: implications for plant evolution under climate change and the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau","ABSTRACT":"BACKGROUND:  The historical orogenesis and associated climatic changes of mountain areas have been suggested to partly account for the occurrence of high levels of biodiversity and endemism. However, their effects on dispersal, differentiation and evolution of many groups of plants are still unknown. In this study, we examined the detailed diversification history of Primula sect. Armerina, and used biogeographic analysis and macro-evolutionary modeling to investigate a series of different questions concerning the evolution of the geographical and ecological distribution of the species in this section. RESULTS:  We sequenced five chloroplast and one nuclear genes for species of Primula sect. Armerina. Neither chloroplast nor nuclear trees support the monophyly of the section. The major incongruences between the two trees occur among closely related species and may be explained by hybridization. Our dating analyses based on the chloroplast dataset suggest that this section began to diverge from its relatives around 3.55 million years ago, largely coinciding with the last major uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Biogeographic analysis supports the origin of the section in the Himalayan Mountains and dispersal from the Himalayas to Northeastern QTP, Western QTP and Hengduan Mountains. Furthermore, evolutionary models of ecological niches show that the two P. fasciculata clades have significantly different climatic niche optima and rates of niche evolution, indicating niche evolution under climatic changes and further providing evidence for explaining their biogeographic patterns. CONCLUSION:  Our results support the hypothesis that geologic and climatic events play important roles in driving biological diversification of organisms in the QTP area. The Pliocene uplift of the QTP and following climatic changes most likely promoted both the inter- and intraspecific divergence of Primula sect. Armerina. This study also illustrates how niche evolution under climatic changes influences biogeographic patterns.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/112772","SDG":13}

Range-size reduction in high mountain plant species is predicted to be more pronounced for endemic species. Investigating the broad temporal spectrum of range shifts is important for the conservation of biodiversity, since learning how species responded to climate change in the past provides useful insights on how they might react to warming trends in the present and future. Using species distribution models and an ensemble forecasting approach, we explored how the distribution of Berardia subacaulis, a monospecific genus endemic of the south-west Alps, may be affected by past and future projected climate change. During the last interglacial, the habitat suitability of Berardia was lower than present and a progressive increase was observed from the last glacial maximum until now. In the future, Berardia appears to lose more than 80 % of its range, becoming endangered by 2050. Our results suggest that Berardia probably survived past warmer periods in situ, expanding its distributional range during cooler periods. The severe future range contraction predicted for Berardia reflects similar results for other endemic species. As Berardia represents an interesting model species to evaluate the effects of climate warming on range size and shifts, demographic and precise range monitoring may be undertaken on this species.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/111309","SDG":15}

However, our current understanding of how wastewater treatment operations influence microbial communities and their micropollutant biotransformation potential is limited, leaving major parts of observed variability in biotransformation rates across treatment facilities unexplained. Here, we present biotransformation rate constants for 42 micropollutants belonging to different chemical classes along a gradient of solids retention time (SRT). The geometric mean of biomass-normalized first-order rate constants shows a clear increase between 3 and 15 d SRT by 160% and 87%, respectively, in two experiments. However, individual micropollutants show a variety of trends. Rate constants of oxidative biotransformation reactions mostly increased with SRT. Yet, nitrifying activity could be excluded as primary driver. For substances undergoing other than oxidative reactions, i.e., mostly substitution-type reactions, more diverse dependencies on SRT were observed. Most remarkably, characteristic trends were observed for groups of substances undergoing similar types of initial transformation reaction, suggesting that shared enzymes or enzyme systems that are conjointly regulated catalyze biotransformation reactions within such groups. These findings open up opportunities for correlating rate constants with measures of enzyme abundance such as genes or gene products, which in turn should help to identify enzymes associated with the respective biotransformation reactions.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/162390","SDG":15}

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:167418","TITLE":"Ecological succession drives the structural change of seed-rodent interaction networks in fragmented forests","ABSTRACT":"While deforestation and fragmentation can cause massive species loss in forest ecosystems, forest regeneration can also drive successional changes in species composition. Although studies have sometimes documented the effects of these compositional changes on interspecific interactions, few studies have investigated changes in the structure of plant-animal networks. We investigated how interaction networks of assemblages of rodents and tree seeds changed with forest fragmentation and succession in a subtropical region. We compared seed-rodent interactions between 14 secondary forest patches that ranged in area from 2 to 58\u202fha, and from 10 to at least 100\u202fyears old, representing a successional gradient. We expected that deforestation and fragmentation would reduce seed production and diversify rodent communities, resulting in higher interaction strengths and connectivity, but weak nestedness (i.e., specialists interact with subsets of the species interaction of generalists). We measured the frequency of rodents eating and removing seeds (interaction strength) in each patch during 3 successive years, using seed tagging and infrared camera trapping, and calculated the properties of the seed-rodent networks. We found that the relative abundances of seeds and rodents changed with stand age not patch size, as did seed-rodent interactions: older patches produced more seeds, contained fewer individuals and species of rodents, and had seed-rodent networks with lower connectance and interaction strength, but higher nestedness. Connectance and interaction strength decreased with metabolic per capita seed availability (as measured by seed energy value); nestedness increased with seed richness, but decreased with rodent abundance. At species level, we found stand age and patch size showed significant effects on seed or rodent abundance of a few species. We also found seed coat thickness and starch contents had significant effects on network metrics. Our results suggest that during succession after deforestation, seed-rodent interactions in these sub-tropical forests change from a state dominated by high seed removal and highly connected seed-rodent networks to a state with more seeds and highly nested networks. From a management perspective of our study region, succession age, not fragment size, and network structure should be paid more attention so as to facilitate the restoration processes of degraded forests. Rodent management should be applied to protect native forest species and exclude incursive ones from farmlands and human residences at early succession stage.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/167418","SDG":15}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:141007","TITLE":"Comparing species interaction networks along environmental gradients","ABSTRACT":"Knowledge of species composition and their interactions, in the form of interaction networks, is required to understand processes shaping their distribution over time and space. As such, comparing ecological networks along environmental gradients represents a promising new research avenue to understand the organization of life. Variation in the position and intensity of links within networks along environmental gradients may be driven by turnover in species composition, by variation in species abundances and by abiotic influences on species interactions. While investigating changes in species composition has a long tradition, so far only a limited number of studies have examined changes in species interactions between networks, often with differing approaches. Here, we review studies investigating variation in network structures along environmental gradients, highlighting how methodological decisions about standardization can influence their conclusions. Due to their complexity, variation among ecological networks is frequently studied using properties that summarize the distribution or topology of interactions such as number of links, connectance, or modularity. These properties can either be compared directly or using a procedure of standardization. While measures of network structure can be directly related to changes along environmental gradients, standardization is frequently used to facilitate interpretation of variation in network properties by controlling for some co-variables, or via null models. Null models allow comparing the deviation of empirical networks from random expectations and are expected to provide a more mechanistic understanding of the factors shaping ecological networks when they are coupled with functional traits. As an illustration, we compare approaches to quantify the role of trait matching in driving the structure of plant-hummingbird mutualistic networks, i.e. a direct comparison, standardized by null models and hypothesis-based metaweb. Overall, our analysis warns against a comparison of studies that rely on distinct forms of standardization, as they are likely to highlight different signals. Fostering a better understanding of the analytical tools available and the signal they detect will help produce deeper insights into how and why ecological networks vary along environmental gradients.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/141007","SDG":0}

Experiments and models have revealed positive, negative and no effects of diversity on individual components of stability, such as temporal variability, resistance and resilience2,3,6,11,12,14. How these stability components covary remains poorly understood15. Similarly, the effects of diversity on overall ecosystem stability16, which is conceptually akin to ecosystem multifunctionality17,18, remain unknown. Here we studied communities of aquatic ciliates to understand how temporal variability, resistance and overall ecosystem stability responded to diversity (that is, species richness) in a large experiment involving 690 micro-ecosystems sampled 19 times over 40 days, resulting in 12,939 samplings. Species richness increased temporal stability but decreased resistance to warming. Thus, two stability components covaried negatively along the diversity gradient. Previous biodiversity manipulation studies rarely reported such negative covariation despite general predictions of the negative effects of diversity on individual stability components3. Integrating our findings with the ecosystem multifunctionality concept revealed hump- and U-shaped effects of diversity on overall ecosystem stability. That is, biodiversity can increase overall ecosystem stability when biodiversity is low, and decrease it when biodiversity is high, or the opposite with a U-shaped relationship. The effects of diversity on ecosystem multifunctionality would also be hump- or U-shaped if diversity had positive effects on some functions and negative effects on others. Linking the ecosystem multifunctionality concept and ecosystem stability can transform the perceived effects of diversity on ecological stability and may help to translate this science into policy-relevant information.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/164959","SDG":15}

In spite of the heterogeneity of cold-adapted species, two main contrasting hypotheses have been proposed to explain their responses to Late Quaternary glacial cycles, namely, the interglacial contraction versus the interglacial expansion hypotheses. Here, we use the cold-adapted plant Primula farinosa to test two demographic models under each of the two alternative hypotheses and a fifth, null model. We first approximate the time and extent of demographic contractions and expansions during the Late Quaternary by projecting species distribution models across the last 72 ka. We also generate genome-wide sequence data using a Reduced Representation Library approach to reconstruct the spatial structure, genetic diversity, and phylogenetic relationships of lineages within P. farinosa. Finally, by integrating the results of climatic and genomic analyses in an Approximate Bayesian Computation framework, we propose the most likely model for the extent and direction of population-size changes in P. farinosa through the Late Quaternary. Our results support the interglacial expansion of P. farinosa, differing from the prevailing paradigm that the observed distribution of cold-adapted species currently fragmented in high altitude and latitude regions reflects the consequences of postglacial contraction processes.

Flood frequency analysis should therefore be undertaken at a regional scale which requires the considerations of the dependence of events at different locations. This dependence is often neglected even though its consideration is essential to derive reliable flood estimates. A model used in regional multivariate frequency analysis should ideally consider the dependence of events at multiple sites which might show dependence in the lower and\/or upper tail of the distribution. We here seek to propose a simple model that on the one hand considers this dependence with respect to the network structure of the region and on the other hand allows for the simulation of stochastic event sets at both gauged and ungauged locations. The new Fisher copula model is used for representing the spatial dependence of flood events in the nested Thur catchment in Switzerland. Flood event samples generated for the gauged stations using the Fisher copula are compared to samples generated by other dependence models allowing for modeling of multivariate data including elliptical copulas, R-vine copulas, and max-stable models. The comparison of the dependence structures of the generated samples shows that the Fisher copula is a suitable model for capturing the spatial dependence in the data. We therefore use the copula in a way such that it can be used in an interpolation context to simulate event sets comprising gauged and ungauged locations. The spatial event sets generated using the Fisher copula well capture the general dependence structure in the data and the upper tail dependence, which is of particular interest when looking at extreme flood events and when extrapolating to higher return periods. The Fisher copula was for a medium-sized catchment found to be a suitable model for the stochastic simulation of flood event sets at multiple gauged and ungauged locations.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/170221","SDG":0}

In particular, we make a distintion between (a) second order\u2010based approaches and (b) practical approaches to modeling temporally evolving global processes. The former approaches are based on the specification of a class of space\u2013time covariance functions, with space being the two\u2010dimensional sphere. The latter are based on explicit description of the dynamics of the space\u2013time process, that is, by specifying its evolution as a function of its past history with added spatially dependent noise. We focus primarily on approach (a), for which the literature has been sparse. We provide new models of space\u2013time covariance functions for random fields defined on spheres cross time. Practical approaches (b) are also discussed, with special emphasis on models built directly on the sphere, without projecting spherical coordinates onto the plane.

We use the statistical software R for model fitting and to demonstrate similarities and complementarities between LMs and MMs. The formation of contrasts and the use of error (LMs) or random-effects (MMs) terms to account for hierarchical data structure in ANOVAs are explained.\r\nImportant Findings: Data from biodiversity experiments can be analyzed at the level of entire plant communities (plots) and plant individuals. The basic explanatory term is species composition, which can be divided into contrasts in many ways depending on specific biological hypotheses. Typically, these contrasts code for aspects of species richness or the presence of particular species. For significance tests in ANOVAs, contrast terms generally are compared with remaining variation of the explanatory terms from which they have been \u2018carved out\u2019. Once a final model has been selected, parameters (e.g. means or slopes for fixed-effects terms and variance components for error or random-effects terms) can be estimated to indicate the direction and size of effects.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/145139","SDG":0}

To make good use of this information, we express flood hydrograph shapes as continuous functions using a functional data approach. We propose a clustering approach based on functional data for flood hydrograph shapes to identify a set of representative hydrograph shapes on a catchment scale and use these catchment-specific sets of representative hydrographs to establish regions of catchments with similar flood reactivity on a regional scale. We applied this approach to flood samples of 163 medium-size Swiss catchments. The results indicate that three representative hydrograph shapes sufficiently describe the hydrograph shape variability within a catchment and therefore can be used as a proxy for the flood behavior of a catchment. These catchment-specific sets of three hydrographs were used to group the catchments into three reactivity regions of similar flood behavior. These regions were not only characterized by similar hydrograph shapes and reactivity but also by event magnitudes and triggering event conditions. We envision these regions to be useful in regionalization studies, regional flood frequency analyses, and to allow for the construction of synthetic design hydrographs in ungauged catchments. The clustering approach based on functional data which establishes these regions is very flexible and has the potential to be extended to other geographical regions or towards the use in climate impact studies.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/149832","SDG":13}

To test whether this result can be extrapolated to forests, the main contributors to terrestrial primary productivity, requires large-scale experiments. We manipulated tree species richness by planting more than 150,000 trees in plots with 1 to 16 species. Simulating multiple extinction scenarios, we found that richness strongly increased stand-level productivity. After 8 years, 16-species mixtures had accumulated over twice the amount of carbon found in average monocultures and similar amounts as those of two commercial monocultures. Species richness effects were strongly associated with functional and phylogenetic diversity. A shrub addition treatment reduced tree productivity, but this reduction was smaller at high shrub species richness. Our results encourage multispecies afforestation strategies to restore biodiversity and mitigate climate change.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/165038","SDG":15}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:165578","TITLE":"A plant biodiversity effect resolved to a single chromosomal region","ABSTRACT":"Despite extensive evidence that biodiversity promotes plant community productivity, progress towards understanding the mechanistic basis of this effect remains slow, impeding the development of predictive ecological theory and agricultural applications. Here, we analysed non-additive interactions between genetically divergent Arabidopsis accessions in experimental plant communities. By combining methods from ecology and quantitative genetics, we identify a major effect locus at which allelic differences between individuals increase the above-ground productivity of communities. In experiments with near-isogenic lines, we show that this diversity effect acts independently of other genomic regions and can be resolved to a single region representing less than 0.3% of the genome. Using plant\u2013soil feedback experiments, we also demonstrate that allelic diversity causes genotype-specific soil legacy responses in a consecutive growing period, even after the original community has disappeared. Our work thus suggests that positive diversity effects can be linked to single Mendelian factors, and that a range of complex community properties can have a simple cause. This may pave the way to novel breeding strategies, focusing on phenotypic properties that manifest themselves beyond isolated individuals; that is, at a higher level of biological organization.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/165578","SDG":0}

The use of the sun in this way has been suggested to occur in either a time-dependent (relying on specific positional information) or a time-compensated manner (a compass that adjusts itself over time with the shifts in the sun\u2019s position). However, some interplay may occur between the two where a species could also use the sun in a time-limited way, whereby animals acquire certain information about the change of position, but do not show full compensational abilities. We tested whether Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris) use the sun as an orientation marker to provide information for caching and recovery. This species is a social sciurid that inhabits arid, sparsely vegetated habitats in Southern Africa, where the sun is nearly always visible during the diurnal period. Due to the lack of obvious landmarks, we predicted that they might use positional cues from the sun in the sky as a reference point when caching and recovering food items. We provide evidence that Cape ground squirrels use information from the sun\u2019s position while caching and reuse this information in a time-limited way when recovering these caches.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/134986","SDG":0}

Benefits can be increased, and costs reduced by preferentially choosing specific locations within a group best adjusted to an individual\u2019s needs or by associating with specific group members and\/or avoiding others. We investigated the spatial structure of meerkat (Suricata suricatta) groups and whether it was shaped by social factors such as affiliation or aggression among group members, predation risk, foraging success, or a mix of these different factors. Using social network analyses, based on spatial networks, we found associations between the dominant pair, among males and among same aged individuals, and dis-assortment by sex only in one to two of the six groups. In addition, the structure of meerkat groups was highly variable, as individual strength within the calculated networks was not repeatable over time. Meerkats seemed to adjust their location to their physical environment, as dominant individuals were located further toward the front of the group, where foraging success is likely higher and young individuals located further toward the back of the group, where they can benefit most from the vigilance effort of their conspecifics. We conclude that meerkat groups display a dynamic spatial structure depending on both the current social and physical environmental.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/168280","SDG":0}

Yet, our understanding of the adaptive significance of sperm ornaments and the cryptic female preferences driving their evolution is extremely limited. Here we review the evolutionary allometry of exaggerated sexual traits (for example, antlers, horns, tail feathers, mandibles and dewlaps), show that the giant sperm of some Drosophila species are possibly the most extreme ornaments in all of nature and demonstrate how their existence challenges theories explaining the intensity of sexual selection, mating-system evolution and the fundamental nature of sex differences. We also combine quantitative genetic analyses of interacting sex-specific traits in D. melanogaster with comparative analyses of the condition dependence of male and female reproductive potential across species with varying ornament size to reveal complex dynamics that may underlie sperm-length evolution. Our results suggest that producing few gigantic sperm evolved by (1) Fisherian runaway selection mediated by genetic correlations between sperm length, the female preference for long sperm and female mating frequency, and (2) longer sperm increasing the indirect benefits to females. Our results also suggest that the developmental integration of sperm quality and quantity renders post-copulatory sexual selection on ejaculates unlikely to treat male\u2013male competition and female choice as discrete processes.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/124422","SDG":0}

However, less is known about the extent of natural variation in these investments relative to environmental variables affecting resource availability and mating system dynamics, which would allow insights into the mechanisms shaping reproductive allocation. Here, we studied interpopulation variation in male investments in testis size and sperm length across 25 populations of the Asian grass frog Fejervarya limnocharis along a 1550-km latitudinal and 1403-m altitudinal transect in China.We found relative testis mass and sperm length, male somatic condition, and the male\/female sex ratio to increase with elevation but not latitude or longitude. Our results suggest that environmental variation may underlie local adaptations to reproductive investments among natural populations, mediated by differences in the availability of both resources and sexual partners (including the resulting male\u2013male competition). These findings contrast with previous predictions that increasing latitude and\/or elevation should lead to declining reproductive investments in male anurans due to shortening breeding seasons, declining resource availability, and lowering (rather than increasing) male\/female sex ratios. We discuss these species differences in the context of differential resource allocation strategies, breeding ecology, and patterns of male\u2013male competition. These differences show the need for future work on reproductive investments in anurans beyond the few model systems and for potential extension of the theoretical framework to species with different mating systems and strategies.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/123960","SDG":0}

Although the majority of the terrestrial biodiversity is hidden in soils, very little is known about the importance of the diversity of microbial communities for soil functioning. Here, we tested effects of biodiversity on the functioning of methanotrophs, a specialized group of soil bacteria that plays a key role in mediating greenhouse gas emissions from soils. Using pure strains of methanotrophic bacteria, we assembled artificial communities of different diversity levels, with which we inoculated sterile soil microcosms. To assess the functioning of these communities, we measured methane oxidation by gas chromatography throughout the experiment and determined changes in community composition and community size at several time points by quantitative PCR and sequencing. We demonstrate that microbial diversity had a positive overyielding effect on methane oxidation, in particular at the beginning of the experiment. This higher assimilation of CH4 at high diversity translated into increased growth and significantly larger communities towards the end of the study. The overyielding of mixtures with respect to CH4 consumption and community size were positively correlated. The temporal CH4 consumption profiles of strain monocultures differed, raising the possibility that temporal complementarity of component strains drove the observed community-level strain richness effects; however, the community niche metric we derived from the temporal activity profiles did not explain the observed strain richness effect. The strain richness effect also was unrelated to both the phylogenetic and functional trait diversity of mixed communities. Overall, our results suggest that positive biodiversity\u2013ecosystem-function relationships show similar patterns across different scales and may be widespread in nature. Additionally, biodiversity is probably also important in natural methanotrophic communities for the ecosystem function methane oxidation. Therefore, maintaining soil conditions that support a high diversity of methanotrophs may help to reduce the emission of the greenhouse gas methane.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/149842","SDG":13}

Plant species loss in arable fields had been assessed in many European countries about 30 years ago, and has gained renewed interest during the last few years. A rich historical data set on plots where arable weeds had historically been recorded in Switzerland enabled the study of changes in arable weed species since the 1920s onward. In total, 232 locations with historical plots were revisited. There, we recorded all plant species and their abundances on 100m2 plots. Across all plots the average number of species per plot declined dramatically by more than 60% during the last 90 years. Most species decreased in frequency, but common species stayed more frequent, while rare species \u2212 often characteristic weeds of traditionally managed crop fields \u2212 decreased in frequency or even disappeared. Plant groups with increasing species numbers and frequency were mostly neophytes, grasses and species with high nutrient demand. The above mentioned decline in species number and frequency of rare and characteristic weed species suggests that more effective conservation measures than hitherto taken are needed to ensure their preservation.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/136504","SDG":15}

However, the links between the evolution and distribution of biodiversity and the formation of mountains remain poorly understood. Here, we integrate multiple datasets to assess the relationships between species richness in mountains, geology and climate at global and regional scales. Specifically, we analyse how erosion, relief, soil and climate relate to the geographical distribution of terrestrial tetrapods, which include amphibians, birds and mammals. We find that centres of species richness correlate with areas of high temperatures, annual rainfall and topographic relief, supporting previous studies. We unveil additional links between mountain-building processes and biodiversity: species richness correlates with erosion rates and heterogeneity of soil types, with a varying response across continents. These additional links are prominent but under-explored, and probably relate to the interplay between surface uplift, climate change and atmospheric circulation through time. They are also influenced by the location and orientation of mountain ranges in relation to air circulation patterns, and how species diversification, dispersal and refugia respond to climate change. A better understanding of biosphere\u2013lithosphere interactions is needed to understand the patterns and evolution of mountain biodiversity across space and time.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/156904","SDG":15}

{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:139433","TITLE":"Genetics of dispersal","ABSTRACT":"Dispersal is a process of central importance for the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations and communities, because of its diverse consequences for gene flow and demography. It is subject to evolutionary change, which begs the question, what is the genetic basis of this potentially complex trait? To address this question, we (i) review the empirical literature on the genetic basis of dispersal, (ii) explore how theoretical investigations of the evolution of dispersal have represented the genetics of dispersal, and (iii) discuss how the genetic basis of dispersal influences theoretical predictions of the evolution of dispersal and potential consequences. Dispersal has a detectable genetic basis in many organisms, from bacteria to plants and animals. Generally, there is evidence for significant genetic variation for dispersal or dispersal-related phenotypes or evidence for the micro-evolution of dispersal in natural populations. Dispersal is typically the outcome of several interacting traits, and this complexity is reflected in its genetic architecture: while some genes of moderate to large effect can influence certain aspects of dispersal, dispersal traits are typically polygenic. Correlations among dispersal traits as well as between dispersal traits and other traits under selection are common, and the genetic basis of dispersal can be highly environment-dependent. By contrast, models have historically considered a highly simplified genetic architecture of dispersal. It is only recently that models have started to consider multiple loci influencing dispersal, as well as non-additive effects such as dominance and epistasis, showing that the genetic basis of dispersal can influence evolutionary rates and outcomes, especially under non-equilibrium conditions. For example, the number of loci controlling dispersal can influence projected rates of dispersal evolution during range shifts and corresponding demographic impacts. Incorporating more realism in the genetic architecture of dispersal is thus necessary to enable models to move beyond the purely theoretical towards making more useful predictions of evolutionary and ecological dynamics under current and future environmental conditions. To inform these advances, empirical studies need to answer outstanding questions concerning whether specific genes underlie dispersal variation, the genetic architecture of context-dependent dispersal phenotypes and behaviours, and correlations among dispersal and other traits.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/139433","SDG":0}

Such work across research disciplines is not without its challenges.

First, our transdisciplinary approach allows combining different disciplines into a more holistic perspective towards integrative research, but demands collaborative work to establish common terminology, concepts, and metrics. Second, the research theme's common perspective (biodiversity is desirable, global change is not) may also induce a confirmation bias from preconceived ideas. Third, new challenges emerge from scaling mechanisms and feedbacks at different spatial and temporal scales. Fourth, we investigate how to relate biodiversity, global change, ecosystem services and functions using interdisciplinary approaches. Fifth, we identify gaps between existing experiments and data requirements, and propose the definition of new experimental setups by linking processes and performing experiments at typical experimental scales as well as at larger scales. We conclude by emphasising the necessity to integrate theory, experiments, modelling and simulation, high performance computing and big data to understand feedbacks between biodiversity loss and processes of global change.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/151858","SDG":15}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:149830","TITLE":"Predicting missing values in spatio-temporal remote sensing data","ABSTRACT":"Continuous, consistent, and long time-series from remote sensing are essential to monitoring changes on Earth's surface. However, analyzing such data sets is often challenging due to missing values introduced by cloud cover, missing orbits, sensor geometry artifacts, and so on. We propose a new and accurate spatio-temporal prediction method to replace missing values in remote sensing data sets. The method exploits the spatial coherence and temporal seasonal regularity that are inherent in many data sets. The key parts of the method are: 1) the adaptively chosen spatio-temporal subsets around missing values; 2) the ranking of images within the subsets based on a scoring algorithm; 3) the estimation of empirical quantiles characterizing the missing values; and 4) the prediction of missing values through quantile regression. One advantage of quantile regression is the robustness to outliers, which enables more accurate parameter retrieval in the analysis of remote sensing data sets. In addition, we provide bootstrap-based quantification of prediction uncertainties. The proposed prediction method was applied to a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data set from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and assessed with realistic test data sets featuring between 20% and 50% missing values. Validation against established methods showed that the proposed method has a good performance in terms of the root-mean-squared prediction error and significantly outperforms its competitors. This paper is accompanied by the open-source R package gapfill, which provides a flexible, fast, and ready-to-use implementation of the method.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/149830","SDG":0}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:142657","TITLE":"The evolution of male-biased sexual size dimorphism is associated with increased body size plasticity in males","ABSTRACT":"1. Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) can vary drastically across environments, demonstrating pronounced sex-specific plasticity. In insects, females are usually the larger and more plastic sex. However, the shortage of taxa with male-biased SSD hampers the assessment of whether the greater plasticity in females is driven by selection on size or represents an effect of the female reproductive role. Here, we specifically address the role of sex-specific plasticity of body size in the evolution of SSD reversals to disentangle sex and size effects.\r\n2. We first investigate sex-specific body size plasticity in Sepsis punctum and Sepsis neocynipsea as two independent cases of intraspecific SSD reversals in sepsid flies. In both species, directional variation in SSD between populations is driven by stronger sexual selection on male size. Using controlled laboratory breeding, we find evidence for sex-specific plasticity and increased condition dependence of male size in populations with male-biased SSD, but not of female size in populations with female-biased SSD.\r\n3. To extend the comparative scope, we next estimate sex-specific body size plasticity in eight additional fly species that differ in the direction of SSD under laboratory conditions. In all species with male-biased SSD we find males to be the more plastic sex, while this was only rarely the case in species with female-biased SSD, thus suggesting a more general trend in Diptera.\r\n4. To examine the generality of this pattern in holometabolous insects, we combine our data with data from the literature in a meta-analysis. Again, male body size tends to be more plastic than female size when males are the larger sex, though female size is now also generally more plastic when females are larger.\r\n5. Our findings indicate that primarily selection on size, rather than the reproductive role per se, drives the evolution of sex-specific body size plasticity. However, sepsid flies, and possibly Diptera in general, show a clear sexual asymmetry with greater male than female plasticity related to SSD, likely driven by strong sexual selection on males. Although further research controlling for phylogenetic and ecological confounding effects is needed, our findings are congruent with theory in suggesting that condition dependence plays a pivotal role in the evolution of sexual size dimorphism.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/142657","SDG":0}

Many refugees have been affected by traumatic experiences at home and during their flight, putting them at a heightened risk of developing trauma-related disorders. The new version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) introduced two sibling disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (CPTSD). So far, little is known about risk and protective factors in refugees that are specifically associated with the disturbances in self-organization (DSO) characteristic of CPTSD. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between PTSD and DSO symptoms and traumatic experiences, postmigration difficulties, and social support in a culturally diverse sample of refugees who resettled in Switzerland. A total of 94 refugees (85.1% male; M age = 31.60 years, SD = 10.14, range: 18-61 years) participated in this study. Trained assessors performed either guided questionnaire assessments or structured interviews. In our advice- and help-seeking sample, 32.9% of individuals suffered from PTSD and 21.3% from CPTSD. After controlling for potential gender differences, we found positive associations between PTSD symptoms and trauma exposure, \u03b2 = .22, as well as between DSO symptoms and postmigration living difficulties, \u03b2 = .42, and lack of social support, \u03b2 = .22. Our findings support the notion that it is highly important to consider differential associations among PTSD and DSO symptoms and risk and protective factors to gain a deeper understanding of the trauma-related problems refugees face.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/158263","SDG":0}

Previous research analyzed two mechanisms of why knowledge about others\u2019 norm violations triggers its spread: (1) Actors lower their subjective beliefs about the probability or severity of punishment, or (2) they condition their compliance on others\u2019 compliance. While earlier field studies could hardly disentangle both effects, we use a laboratory experiment which eliminates any punishment threat. Subjects (n = 466) can throw a die and are paid according to their reported number. Our design rules out any possibility of personal identification so that subjects can lie about their thrown number and claim inflated payoffs without risking detection. The aggregate distribution of reported payoffs allows the estimation of the extent to which the honesty norm is violated. We compare two treatment conditions in which subjects are informed about lying behavior of others with a control condition without information feedback. Observations from a subsequent die throw reveal that knowledge about liars triggers the spread of lying compared to the control condition. Our results demonstrate the contagiousness of norm violations, where actors imitate norm violations of others under the exclusion of strategic motives.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/95626","SDG":0}

Further experimental evidence on inspection games","ABSTRACT":"When do more severe punishments not deter crimes and when are stronger incentives for control personnel ineffective to motive control? This contribution shows when incentives for crime control have paradoxical effects. It follows from game theoretical reasoning that the opposed interests between criminals and inspectors lead to strategies, where both seek to outsmart each other. If both do so, ego's incentives only affect alter's behavior. This \"strategic incentive effect\" implies that higher punishments do not cause less crimes, but less inspections. This was experimentally corroborated by Rauhut (2009). The second implication is that stronger inspection incentives do not cause more inspections, but less crimes. This paper studies the second implication under farsighted strategic actors, shows its robustness by agent-based simulations of backward-looking learning and provides experimental evidence. In the laboratory experiment, 200 subjects were partitioned into \"citizens\" who could steal money from each other and \"inspectors\" who could invest in inspection to detect criminal citizens. Results confirm that stronger inspection incentives cause less crime. However, actors are less strategic than predicted: stronger inspection incentives also cause more inspections. This is discussed by differentiating between the \"strategic incentive-effect\", where ego's incentives only affect alter's behavior and the \"own incentive-effect\", where ego's incentives also affect ego's behavior. Conclusions discuss alternative models of rationality and heuristics and how the presented findings may be used for constructing novel theories on crime and social norms. Also policy implications are discussed.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/95931","SDG":0}

An experimental comparison of self- and other-regarding mechanisms for norm adherence","ABSTRACT":"There is a growing body of research showing that people altruistically enforce cooperation norms in social dilemmas. Most of this research analyzes situations where norm violators are known and group members enforce cooperation among each other. However, in many situations norm violators are unknown and detection and punishment is enforced by third parties, such as in plagiarism, tax evasion, doping or even two-timing. Our contribution is threefold. Conceptually, we show the usefulness of inspection game experiments for studying normative behavior in these situations. Methodologically, we present a novel measurement of strategic norm adherence and enforcement, asking for continuous, \"frequentistic\" choice probabilities. Substantively, we demonstrate that norm adherence in these situations is best understood by coexisting distinct actor types. Self-regarding types learn the inspection rate and calibrate their norm violations to maximize own payoffs. Other-regarding types reciprocate experienced victimizations by stealing from other, unknown group members; even at additional costs. We specify both mechanisms by agent-based simulation models and compare their relative strength by behavioral and attitudinal data in inspection game experiments (N=220). Our results suggest a modern sociological perspective, which combines homo oeconomicus with homo sociologicus. Further, our findings contribute to understanding conditional norm compliance in \"broken windows\" dynamics, since we show under controlled conditions that it may result jointly from self- and other regarding mechanisms.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/95628","SDG":0}

It accepts the view that moral philosophy does serve public interest. However, it rejects the reasons that are typically provided for such a position. It rejects the claim that the beneficial role of moral philosophy is due to moral philosophers\u2019 expertise which allows them to provide the public with the right answers to moral questions. Instead, it holds that the benefits are to be found elsewhere. Moral experts, the paper argues, differ from experts on non-normative issues. One should not act on the judgements of moral philosophers. This is not because moral philosophers are unlikely to get it right in moral matters, but because one only has reasons to follow their judgements if one has a moral understanding of the practical issues in question. And in this respect, it is argued, moral philosophy can indeed serve a public interest, namely by improving people\u2019s moral understanding.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/101521","SDG":0}

Relying on social identity theory as an explanatory framework, this article argues that populist citizens assume that public opinion is congruent with their own opinion and that mainstream media reporting is hostile toward their own views. To date, only anecdotal evidence suggests that both assumptions are true. The relationships are investigated in a cross-sectional survey with samples drawn from four Western European countries (N = 3,354). Multigroup regression analysis supports our hypotheses: False consensus and hostile media perceptions can clearly be linked to populist attitudes in all four regions under investigation. Moreover, our findings show a gap between hostile media perceptions and congruent public opinion perceptions, which increases with increasing populist attitudes to the point that the persuasive press inference mechanism is annulled.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/158179","SDG":0}

The present research tested the hypothesis that affirming conflicting groups' agency would increase their members' mutual prosociality. The effectiveness of agency affirmation was demonstrated in three contexts of conflict between groups: Switzerland and the EU following the 2014 referendum (Study 1), Israelis and Palestinians (Study 2), and Israeli rightists and leftists (Study 3). Study 1 found that in a nonconflictual context Swiss participants prioritized their moral (prosocial) over agentic goals, yet in the context of conflict with the EU, they prioritized their agentic over moral goals. This \u201cprimacy-of-agency\u201d effect, however, was eliminated once their ingroup's agency was affirmed. Studies 2 and 3 demonstrated the positive effect of agency affirmation on prosociality among Israelis referring to Palestinians and Israeli rightists and leftists referring to the adversarial political camp. This effect was mediated by group members' readiness to relinquish some power for the sake of morality. Pointing to the importance of the affirmation's specific content, Studies 2 and 3 demonstrated that morality affirmation failed to increase prosociality. As such, the present research puts forward a promising strategy to reduce hostility and promote prosociality between conflicting groups.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/136480","SDG":0}

We identify three roles\u2014as gatekeepers, interpreters, and initiators\u2014the media can assume in their coverage of populist actors, populist ideology, and populist communication. A comparative content analysis of nine thousand stories from fifty-nine news outlets in ten European countries shows that both media factors (e.g., tabloid orientation) and political factors (e.g., response of mainstream parties) influence the extent and nature of populism in the media. Although newspapers in most countries do not overrepresent populist actors and tend to evaluate them negatively, we still find abundant populist content in the news. Several media outlets like to present themselves as mouthpieces of the people while, at the same time, cover politicians and parties with antiinstitutional undertones.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/158076","SDG":0}

Every year, tens of thousands of homeless individuals, drug addicts, teenagers, protesters and others are banned from parts of public space. The rise of exclusion measures is characteristic of two broader developments that have profoundly transformed public space in recent years: the privatisation of public space, and its increased control in the 'security society'. Despite the fundamental problems it raises, exclusion from public space has received hardly any attention from legal scholars. This book addresses this gap and comprehensively explores the implications that this new form of intervention has for the constitutional essentials of liberal democracy: the rule of law, fundamental rights, and democracy. To do so, it analyses legal developments in three liberal democracies that have been at the forefront of promoting exclusion measures: the United Kingdom, the United States, and Switzerland.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/128776","SDG":16}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:157219","TITLE":"The cognitive foundations of cooperation","ABSTRACT":"Why do some individuals cooperate with their fellow human beings while others take advantage of them? The human drive for cooperation and altruism is one of the most powerful forces shaping our society, but there is an enormous behavioral variance in individual behavior. At the same time, whether it is intuitive to behave in a cooperative manner or whether such behaviors are calculated deeds remains an unanswered question. Indeed, recent empirical investigations regarding the spontaneity of human cooperation have found mixed evidence, possibly due to a failure to induce compliance in the behavioral manipulations employed. We conducted a laboratory experiment inducing intuitive and deliberative behavior through gradual economic incentives that ensure compliance. To account for individual heterogeneity, we independently measured social value orientation and aversion to interpersonal (strategic) uncertainty. We find that these measures determine the intrinsic predisposition towards cooperation. Subjects with more altruistic social values or a higher tolerance towards interpersonal uncertainty are more cooperative. Crucially, we find causal evidence that there is no universal default mode of behavior. Rather, intuition enhances intrinsic predispositions, while deliberation moderates them towards socially acceptable behavior. That is, subjects with a higher (resp. lower) predisposition towards cooperation became more (resp. less) cooperative under time pressure compared with time delay.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/157219","SDG":0}

To be able to execute its various roles, the state needs to acquire the capacity to enforce compliance with tax obligations. In developing countries, this task is far from obvious. Taxation is particularly challenging in less formalized economies, since it is difficult for the government to gain information about what taxable transactions actually occurred. One important source of information that governments rely on are paper trails by third parties, which document such transactions. This talk presents evidence from Chile and Ecuador on the power and limitations of such paper trails. It also discusses the challenges that can emerge as countries introduce the use of third-party reported information for tax enforcement. The evidence suggests that despite the (helpful) growth of computer-based monitoring using cross-checks of third-party information, strengthening the traditional enforcement capacity of developing country governments still remains crucial for effective tax collection.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/153012","SDG":17}

To avoid selection issues present in natural environments, we use an experiment in which we create simple laboratory firms and assign leadership roles at random. In our first experiment, firms engage in competition and unethical behavior enhances firm earnings but produces a negative externality for all firms. We vary, by treatment, two instruments through which leaders can influence follower conduct\u2014prominent statements to the group and the allocation of monetary incentives. We find that leaders influence the ethical conduct of followers both through their statements and through the use of incentives. Moreover, leaders who are likely to have acted dishonestly in a preliminary stage of the experiment are more likely to employ mechanisms to encourage dishonesty among followers. As a result, firms randomly assigned one of these unethical leaders are more likely to engage in misreporting. A second experiment finds that the above relationships are present, though weaker, when firms do not engage in direct competition.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/147177","SDG":0}

We compared the predictive validities of the Juvenile Sex Offender Assessment Protocol II (J-SOAP II), the Estimate of Risk of Adolescent Sexual Offense Recidivism (ERASOR), and the Violence Risk Appraisal Guide-Revised (VRAG-R) scores concerning sexual, nonsexual-violent, and general criminal recidivism (based on both official and nonregistered reoffenses) in a consecutive sample of 597 male JSOs (Mage = 14.47 years, SDage = 1.57 years) while accounting for different recidivism periods, offense severities, and cumulative burden of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves and Cox regression analyses indicated that the tools allowed valid predictions of recidivism according to their intended purposes: The ERASOR was best suited to predict sexual recidivism within 0.5 and 3 years, the J-SOAP II was valid for predictions of sexual and nonsexual-violent recidivism within these recidivism periods, and the VRAG-R showed potential strengths in predicting nonsexual-violent recidivism, especially when committed above age 18. Elevated offense severity and burden of ACEs impeded predictive accuracies of the J-SOAP II and the VRAG-R, particularly in case of sexual recidivism. Our findings emphasize that risk assessment for JSOs must not rely solely on scores derived from risk assessment instruments, but a comprehensive consideration of a JSOs offense severity and psychosocial adversities is additionally necessary to approach accurate risk appraisals.

Do these needs translate into specific goals in social interactions? In the present research, we examined the hypotheses that (1) experiencing one\u2019s ingroup as illegitimately disadvantaged or victimized arouses agentic goals (to act and appear assertive and confident) when interacting with the advantaged or victimizing group, while (2) experiencing one\u2019s ingroup as illegitimately advantaged or perpetrating transgressions arouses communal goals (to act and appear warm and trustworthy) when interacting with the disadvantaged or victimized group. Study 1 (N = 391) generally supported both hypotheses across diverse intergroup contexts involving gender, national\/ethnic, and consumer identities. Study 2 (N = 122) replicated this pattern in a context of occupational identities. Study 2 further showed that the effect of ingroup role on agentic and communal intergroup goals was not moderated by participants\u2019 general dispositional preferences for agentic and communal goals in interpersonal interactions, thus demonstrating how ingroup role exerts a distinct and robust influence on goals for interactions with other groups.

The present study used Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to derive subtypes of JSOs according to their patterns of 10 different ACEs. An extensive file analysis of 322 male JSOs ( M = 14.14, SD = 1.94) revealed five subtypes with (a) multiple (9.0%), (b) mainly family related (17.1%), (c) mainly peer related (21.7%), (d) mainly neglectful (18.6%), and (e) little\/no (33.5%) ACEs. Differences among ACE subtypes with regard to several offense and victim characteristics (e.g., the use of penetration or violence, the choice of a child, a male, a stranger, or multiple victims) were examined. Whereas no differences were found for the use of physical violence or the choice of male, stranger, or multiple victims, binary logistic regressions revealed associations of the multiple-ACE subtype with the choice of a child victim, the family-ACE subtype with the use of penetration as well as further nonsexual delinquency, the peer-ACE subtype with the use of penetration and the choice of a child victim, and the neglect-subtype with the choice of a child victim. Additional analyses including single ACE categories instead of LCA-derived subtypes supported these results. Findings highlight the need for a comprehensive consideration of ACEs in research and clinical work to understand developmental pathways to juvenile sexual offending.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/143858","SDG":16}

The current study explored how PTSD symptoms change over time across different trauma types and examined mediators of their persistence. A trauma-exposed community sample, whereof approximately one quarter met diagnostic criteria for PTSD, provided retrospective data on the duration of PTSD symptoms. Those who remitted and those who had not at the time of assessment were compared regarding worst trauma, symptom severity, comorbidity, demographic and treatment-seeking variables. Time to remission was estimated using Cox proportional hazard models including candidate predictors of remission. A mediated survival analysis was used to explore indirect pathways that explain trauma-specific differences in remission times. Both the full sample and PTSD subgroup were analyzed separately. Overall, lower socio-economic status, lifetime and childhood sexual trauma, symptom severity, comorbid depression and past treatment were associated with non- and longer remissions. PTSD avoidance symptoms and comorbid depression were found to mediate longer remission times after lifetime or childhood sexual trauma. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms and complicating factors of remission from PTSD symptoms after trauma, which might have important implications for therapeutic interventions.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/149163","SDG":0}

The liberalization of the gold mining sector has given way to complex forms of regulation where non-state and illegal mining entrepreneurs compete in governing mining extraction. Taking the case of gold mining in Burkina Faso, this paper analyses the conditions and dynamics under which such complex regulation takes place. We draw on extensive ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Northern Burkina Faso, in particular the Burkinab\u00e8 mining sector. We argue that enclave economies in the gold mining sector are co-produced by state and market regulation through a \u2018\u2018plurification\u201d of regulatory authority. This \u2018\u2018plurification\u201d is the effect of competition among different frontier entrepreneurs, who seek to broker regulatory authority in mining concession sites. We show that concession sites are not discrete extractive enclaves, but are better understood as indiscrete sites that are entangled in local politics and social relations. Rather than thinning social relations, as is often claimed, we observe that enclave economies thicken politics around concessionary regimes, where governmental bodies re-emerge as an arbitrating regulatory force. These findings problematize policy prescriptions to formalize the gold mining sector and draw attention to the role of the state in re\/producing frontier entrepreneurs with unequal political rights to claiming concessions.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/157430","SDG":16}

Exploring the extension of voting rights in the age of globalization","ABSTRACT":"The introductory article to the special issue discusses how the extension of voting rights beyond citizenship (that is, to non-national immigrants) and residence (that is, to expatriates) can be interpreted in the light of democratization processes in both Western countries and in developing regions. It does so by inserting the globalization-specific extension of voting rights to immigrants and expatriates within the long-term series of historical waves of democratization. Does the current extension enhance democracy by granting de facto disenfranchised immigrants and emigrants political rights or does it jeopardize the very functioning of democracy by undermining its legitimacy through the removal of territorial and national boundaries? The article offers a synthesis of the findings of the volume's contributions in a broad comparative perspective covering both alien and external voting rights in Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America. It shows that reforms toward more expansive electorates vary considerably and that their effects on the inclusion of migrants largely depend on the specific regulations and the socio-political context in which they operate.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/114929","SDG":16}

However, several past studies mixed up values with other dimensions like attitudes, norms, or beliefs, and only a few systematically assessed the effect of values on violent behavior relying on a value theory. Furthermore, in other studies, violence was often analyzed as a composite index of different forms of delinquent behavior rather than as violence per se. In the current study we address these gaps in the literature by building upon Schwartz\u2019 theory of basic human values. We use it to explain attitudes toward interpersonal violence and interpersonal violent behavior. We analyze data of young people (n = 1,810) drawn from a German study in Duisburg, Germany, which assessed various types of self-reported violent behavior as well as values and attitudes toward violence. We test structural equation models in which we explain interpersonal violent behavior with basic human values, and where attitudes toward interpersonal violent behavior mediate this relation. Results show that self-transcendence and conservation values are associated negatively and power and stimulation values positively with interpersonal violent behavior. In addition, attitudes operate as a partial mediator for the former and as a full mediator for the latter in the relation between values and violent behavior. Despite a dominant association between attitudes and behavior, values themselves can significantly contribute to the explanation of violent behavior.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/158678","SDG":16}

The present article attempts to close that gap by proposing a definition of terror as the apprehension of (more) violence to come. Because every terrorist act is perceived to be part of a potential series, terror is oriented towards the future and involves the imaginary anticipation of prospective events. On the basis of this definition, I will examine the problematical role of counterterrorist discourse. As the statements of public officials and security experts in the run-up to, and during, the \"War on Terror\" demonstrate, the peculiar dynamic of terror is, seemingly paradoxically, reinforced by counterterrorist rhetoric. With its insistence on the escalatory nature of terrorist violence and its repeated prediction of even worse attacks, counterterrorism contributes to the evocation of terror in the sense proposed here.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/167595","SDG":16}

This article provides a quantitative analysis of the diffusion of regime contention in 20 countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region between December 2010 and April 2011. Results show that protests that led to a regime change were much more likely to be imitated elsewhere, but especially in the first couple of weeks and without taking the specificity of the context into account. Our analysis thus suggests that regime contention diffused through bounded learning during the Arab Spring.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/114501","SDG":16}

Yet, many insurgent groups continue to target civilians. In this article, we suggest a localized effect of violence on electoral outcomes of parties with ties to violent groups offers an explanation for why such insurgent groups might continue to perpetrate violence. Specifically, we suggest insurgent benefits, measured as electoral costs to the incumbent for failure in stemming the violence, likely outweigh the localized electoral costs to insurgent-affiliated parties from the violence. Our subnational analysis of violence and electoral results across Peruvian provinces strongly supports our story.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/156944","SDG":16}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168027","TITLE":"Nothing to hide, nothing to lose? Incentives and disincentives to sharing information with institutions online","ABSTRACT":"What incentives and disincentives do Internet users weigh as they consider providing information to institutional actors such as government agencies and corporations online? Focus group participants list several benefits to sharing information including convenience, access to information, personalization, financial incentives, and more accurate health information, but also recognize that not all sharing may be in their interest. Disincentives to sharing include skepticism, distrust, and fears of discrimination. Decisions about sharing are related to the information type, the context in which information is revealed, and the institution to which they are \u2013 or think they are \u2013 providing information. Significantly, many participants were mistrustful of both governmental and corporate actors. Participants displayed awareness of privacy risks, but frequently mischaracterized the extent to which information could be aggregated and mined. They displayed resignation towards privacy violations, suggesting that they perceived little control over their ability to protect their privacy, which may influence their privacy behaviors. This calls into question the privacy calculus, as individuals misunderstand the risks of their information provision and do not believe opting out of information-sharing is possible.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/168027","SDG":16}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:168830","TITLE":"Sex differences in intrusive memories following trauma","ABSTRACT":"BACKGROUND: A key mechanism thought to underlie Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is enhanced emotional memory consolidation. Recent evidence in healthy controls revealed that women have greater negative memory consolidation following stress relative to men. This study examined emotional memory consolidation in women and men with PTSD, and in trauma-exposed and non-trauma controls to test the hypothesis that emotionally negative memory consolidation would be greater in women with PTSD.\r\n\r\nMETHOD: One hundred and forty-seven men and women (47 with PTSD, 49 trauma-exposed controls, and 51 non-trauma controls) completed an emotional memory task where they looked at negative, neutral and positive images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Delayed recall and an intrusive memory diary were completed two days later.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Women displayed greater recall, and reported more negative intrusive memories than men. A gender x group interaction effect showed that both women with PTSD and trauma-exposed women reported more intrusive memories than women without trauma exposure or men.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: This study provided preliminary evidence of sex differences in intrusive memories in those with PTSD as well as those with a history of trauma exposure. Future research should include measures of sex hormones to further examine sex differences on memory consolidation in the context of trauma exposure and PTSD.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/168830","SDG":0}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:149185","TITLE":"Mental Defeat and Cumulative Trauma Experiences Predict Trauma-Related Psychopathology: Evidence From a Postconflict Population in Northern Uganda","ABSTRACT":"The peritraumatic cognitive process of mental defeat, the complete loss of inner resistance, has been identified as a key predictor of PTSD. Yet, most evidence on cognitive risk factors stems from industrialized countries where survivors typically report few traumata. Research from postconflict settings indicates that individual differences decrease with accumulating traumatic experiences, as almost everybody develops PTSD at extreme levels of trauma load. Would this leave less room for the impact of cognitive processes? In a sample of 227 Ugandan rebel war survivors, we investigated whether mental defeat influences trauma-related psychopathology in regression models accounting for cumulative trauma exposure. We found strong main effects of mental defeat on lifetime PTSD risk, current PTSD severity and dissociative symptoms, but no mental defeat \u00d7 trauma load interaction effects. Our results indicate that peritraumatic mental defeat is central to understand individual differences in psychological reactions after single traumatic events as well as multiple traumatization.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/149185","SDG":16}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:167623","TITLE":"At war with the unknown: Hollywood, Homeland Security, and the cultural imaginary of terrorism after 9\/11","ABSTRACT":"Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Bush administration established a security discourse based on the paradigm of \"uncertain threats,\" characterizing the \"war on terror\" as a war against the \"unknown.\" From the point of view of this new security discourse, counterterrorism should not confine itself to the accumulation of data concerning the goals, strategies, and means of terrorist networks. It also depends on ingenuity on the part of security analysts in the imagination of possible present and future events. Besides analyzing facts, counterterrorism has to work speculatively through possibilities, to think in the subjunctive. Consequently, members of the Hollywood entertainment industry were invited by the Pentagon in October 2001 \"to brainstorm about possible terrorist targets and schemes in America and to offer solutions to those threats.\" The present article argues that the consideration of fiction as potential fact is symptomatic of the discursive response to terror, which oscillates between the real (actual incidents of political violence) and the imaginary (anticipated further attacks), both drawing on and contributing to what I propose to conceptualize as the cultural imaginary of terrorism. Although this dynamic became particularly salient after 9\/11, it has a much longer history, going back to the first emergence of sub-state violence against public targets at the close of the nineteenth century, when several literary writers devised spectacular scenarios of attacks from the air or with biological weapons. What distinguishes these late-Victorian fictions from post-9\/11 counterterrorist discourse, however, is that the latter has made the imaginary an integral feature of homeland defense and thus a basis for political practice.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/167623","SDG":0}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:161795","TITLE":"The mass politics of international disintegration","ABSTRACT":"In the past few years, the world has witnessed an unprecedented popular backlash against international institutions. Popular demands to not only slow down, but to reverse international integration have proliferated, and have resulted in referendum and election outcomes that have reverberated across the world. Examples range from the Swiss 2014 mass immigration initiative over the British 2016 Brexit referendum to the 2016 election of a US President seemingly determined to withdraw US support from various international treaties. The implications of these mass-based disintegration efforts reach far beyond the countries in which they originate. First, the disintegration process is shaped by how remaining member states respond to one member\u2019s bid to unilaterally change or terminate the terms of an existing international agreement. Second, mass-based disintegration bids also pose considerable risks of political contagion by encouraging disintegrative tendencies in other countries. Yet despite their disruptive nature, very little research exists beyond individual case studies on the general drivers, dynamics and challenges these instances of mass-based disintegration pose for international cooperation. This paper therefore engages in a comparative inquiry into the mass politics of disintegration that pays particular attention to the strategic dilemmas these instances pose for the affected international institutions and their remaining member states. It argues that the remaining member states have incentives to intervene in domestic campaigns in which disintegration figures as a viable outcome, but that the difficulties of successful intervention are considerable. It also shows that after a vote in favor of disintegration, the remaining member states face an \u201caccommodation dilemma\u201d between preserving as many cooperation gains as possible and making exit costly in order to discourage other member states from following suit.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/161795","SDG":16}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:170676","TITLE":"Recalibrating social protection: electoral competition and the new partisan politics of the welfare state","ABSTRACT":"This article investigates the new party politics of welfare states with a particular focus on electoral competition. The argument is that welfare state politics are no longer just about more or less, but involve trade\u2010offs among \u2018new\u2019 versus \u2018old\u2019 social rights, and hence social investment versus social consumption. However, party priorities on these issues are highly dependent upon their electoral situation. As electoral competition becomes more intense, parties focus more on vote maximisation than on their traditional policy goals. For left parties, this means focusing more on social investment, which appeals to their growing constituency of progressive sociocultural professionals, and less on defending the traditional income maintenance programmes favoured by their core blue\u2010collar voters. Centre\u2010right parties, on the other hand, should hesitate to retrench old social rights when electoral competition intensifies because they need to prioritise their appeal to culturally conservative working\u2010class voters over their traditional fiscally conservative policy profiles. Using a new dataset and a recently published measure of electoral competitiveness, the article shows that as electoral competition intensifies, left governments are willing to prioritise social investment by reducing pension rights generosity in order to expand programmes for new social risks, while centre\u2010right governments by contrast avoid retrenchment of pension rights and pension expenditures. The findings demonstrate that this relationship is moderated by the presence of a credible radical right challenger, which increases the electoral risk of welfare state recalibration.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/170676","SDG":0}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:160865","TITLE":"The politics of double delegation in the European Union","ABSTRACT":"Many international organizations channel financial contributions of their member countries through other international organizations to implement their programs and activities. In this context, the second step of the delegation chain is often costly and\u2014at least seemingly\u2014an easily avoidable duplication of a previous one. We examine the puzzling phenomenon of double delegation in the context of European aid. We argue that governments engage in double delegation in order to strengthen the role of the European Union (EU) as a multilateral donor agency. This leads to an increase in the flow of resources that, at times, exceeds what the Commission can effectively handle alone. Delegating aid to other organizations helps the Commission solve this capacity problem, but it also reduces its control over how the resources are spent. Consequently, the Commission must exercise judgment about which projects it delegates to other international organizations. Our quantitative and qualitative evidence shows that double delegation is more likely where the Commission's capacity as an aid donor is low and where EU members have no strategic interests at stake. We also show that the Commission tries to mitigate the loss of control by earmarking the delegated aid projects more tightly, notably when member preferences are heterogeneous. The results provide a new way of thinking about international delegation and bureaucratic politics in international organizations. Delegation problems may occur even if the interests between the principal and the agent align. Our approach highlights why this happens and how actors try to minimize the costs of this understudied type of agency slippage.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/160865","SDG":0}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:144205","TITLE":"Resourcing international organisations: so\u00a0what?","ABSTRACT":"The changes observed in resourcing international organisations over the last decades may have dramatic consequences for their ability to fulfil their mandates. This paper investigates into how far reaching the expected changes really are, and whether the new types and sources of financial and human resources can really be considered as causal for these developments. It appears that resourcing may not be the initial cause, but contributes to the centrifugal dynamics currently observed in the multilateral system. Administrative cost related to the new and complex funding structures are considerable, and ensuring transparency over resource flows represents a major challenge. Official decision-making bodies lose power to sub-groups of members or external actors that fund parts of the organisations\u2019 activities through separate channels. Given the large volume of non-core funding and the lack of transparency, they cannot easily adjust their own priorities. It can thus not be expected that the funding of certain activities through external channels will simply be compensated by a corresponding reduction of core funding in this area. Whether this negatively affects the ability of the organisations to fulfil their mandates \u2013 and hence, eventually their legitimacy \u2013 depends on the motivations of those actors empowered in this process.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/144205","SDG":17}

Our article discusses these issues in the light of existing theory and informed by the empirical analyses assembled in this special issue. \u2018National preferences\u2019 or ideal points of the governments involved are driven by their domestic socio-economic and political conditions and institutions, the dimensionality of the negotiations, and strategic considerations. We then discuss how national preferences, states\u2019 bargaining power, the strategic and institutional bargaining context, and the bargaining dynamics jointly influence the bargaining outcome. Examples from European negotiations in the context of the Eurozone crisis illustrate both the complexity of the process and the value of serious, theoretically informed, empirical analysis.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/170657","SDG":17}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:159516","TITLE":"Noncooperation by popular vote: expectations, foreign intervention, and the vote in the 2015 Greek bailout referendum","ABSTRACT":"When popular referendums fail to ratify new international agreements or succeed in reversing existing ones, it not only affects domestic voters but also creates negative spillovers for the other parties to such agreements. We explore how voters respond to this strategic environment. We use original survey data from a poll fielded just one day before the 2015 Greek bailout referendum\u2014a referendum in which the stakes for other countries were particularly high\u2014to investigate how expectations about the likely foreign response to a noncooperative referendum outcome influence voting behavior and to what extent foreign policymakers can influence those expectations. Our analysis of the Greek referendum shows that such expectations had a powerful effect on voting behavior: voters expecting that a noncooperative referendum outcome would force Greece to leave the eurozone were substantially more likely to vote cooperatively than those believing that it would result in renewed negotiations with the country's creditors. Leveraging the bank closure that took place right before the vote, we also show that costly signals by foreign actors made voters more pessimistic about the consequences of a noncooperative vote and substantially increased the share of cooperative votes.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/159516","SDG":0}
{"ID":"oai:www.zora.uzh.ch:130330","TITLE":"Globalization and the demand-side of politics: how globalization shapes labor market risk perceptions and policy preferences","ABSTRACT":"Does globalization affect the demand-side of politics, and if so, how? This paper builds on new developments in trade theory to argue that globalization matters, but that its effects on individuals\u2019 perceptions of labor market risk and policy preferences are more heterogenous than previous research has acknowledged. Globalization exposure increases risk perceptions and demands for social protection among low-skilled individuals, but decreases them among high-skilled individuals. This conditional effect is observationally distinct from classic trade models as well as arguments that deindustrialization or ideology predominantly drive such perceptions and preferences. Analyzing cross-national survey data from 16 European countries and focusing both on trade and offshoring, the empirical analyses support the prediction that exposure to globalization affects high- and low-skilled individuals differently, leading to variation in labor market risk perceptions and policy preferences.","URL":"https:\/\/www.zora.uzh.ch\/id\/eprint\/130330","SDG":17}
